MAYFIELD, Ky., Dec 12 (Reuters) - Until the power went out on Friday night, Rick Foley was closely tracking the storm system with the help of radar and television news. But when his house in Mayfield, Kentucky, went dark, all he could do was sit tight and wait. Finally he heard the roar.
""My ears popped, and debris started coming through the doorway and I just dropped down on my knees, covered my head, and it was gone in 30 seconds,” the 70-year-old retired boat carpenter said of the moment one of the most powerful tornados in Kentucky history slammed into his home.
In what felt like less than a minute, the facade of the house was completely gone, leaving his living room fireplace exposed and surrounded by a field of rubble.

MADRID, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Investors led by Egypt's EFG Hermes have pledged to pour more than 625 million euros ($725.75 million) into Ignis Energia in return for a stake in the Spanish renewable energy developer, the companies said on Monday.
The deal struck by Vortex Energy, a platform managed by Egypt's largest investment bank, is the latest in a series of cross-border investments in renewable energy, a sector boosted by global targets to cut planet-warming carbon emissions.
Founded in 2015, Ignis wanted funds to help it develop a portfolio which contained renewable projects with more than 14 gigawatts of capacity in 2020.
Vortex Energy will make the investment in stages over the coming years through a series of capital injections, the companies said in a statement. The total 625 million euros would represent 49% of Ignis, a person familiar with the matter said.
Ignis was managing sites with 2.9 GW in total capacity in 2020, turning over 130 million euros ($154.05 million) and employing 200 people, according to its website. It struck a deal to develop a 3.3 gigawatt pipeline of projects with France's TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) last year.

6,"Column: Britain’s old housing stock emerges as key emissions problem: Kemp
LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Britain’s old and badly insulated housing stock is emerging as a major problem for government efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Britain has made rapid headway cutting emissions from power generation over the last decade, but progress reducing emissions from homes has been very much slower.
Stubbornly high emissions from houses and apartments are the most intractable obstacle to achieving the government’s stated target of reducing emissions to net zero by 2050.
Britain’s homes accounted for 66 million tonnes of direct emissions in 2019 as a result of burning gas, oil, coal and other fuels to provide heating and hot water.
They also accounted for another 17 million tonnes of indirect emissions as their share of electricity consumption to provide heating, hot water, lighting and power.
Direct and indirect emissions together accounted for 16% of the country’s total emissions, according to the Climate Change Committee, the government’s official advisory body (“Sixth carbon budget”, 2020).
The country’s total emissions declined by 142 million tonnes per year between 2009 and 2019, a compound annual reduction of around 2.7%.
But decarbonisation of electricity accounted for 93 million tonnes of the reduction, with emissions falling at an average rate of 9% per year.
Emissions from residential fuel combustion fell by only 8 million tonnes, an average compound rate of just 1.2% per year (chartbook:).
Direct emissions from households overtook the power sector for the first time in 2018, underscoring the fact there is no way to reach net zero without faster decarbonisation of domestic heating and hot water systems.
But Britain’s elected policymakers remain reluctant to tackle the issue of residential emissions because it is likely to be very expensive to retrofit existing homes with new insulation and heating systems.
Existing heating and hot water systems are often perceived as having superior user properties to the low-emission electrified systems with which the government wants to replace them.
As a result, there is significant opposition from the tabloid media and sections of the home-owning public to efforts to mandate greater insulation and replace residential combustion systems with electrified ones.
OLD AND BADLY INSULATED
In Britain, the majority of household energy consumption is used for space heating (63%) and hot water (17%), with much smaller amounts used for cooking (3%), lighting (3%) and appliances (13%).
The overwhelming majority of existing homes rely on gas for central heating and hot water (83%) with far fewer relying on oil (6%) and the rest using some form of electric heating.
Gas is the most common heating fuel in every region of the country except Northern Ireland, which was bypassed by the heating revolution that followed the development of North Sea gas in the 1960s and 1970s.
There are almost 24 million gas-fired central heating systems in use, with an average lifespan of 15 years, according to the Building Research Establishment Trust (BRE) (“Housing stock of the United Kingdom”, 2020).
The energy efficiency of the country’s housing stock is low, with many dwellings old and of relatively poor construction quality, which makes them expensive to heat.
“The UK has the oldest housing stock in Europe, and most likely in the world,” according to the BRE. “This is largely due to the legacy of dwellings built during the industrial revolution, which still form the backbone of our urban areas today.”
“While still widely valued, these homes present challenges in making them healthy, safe and suitable for the future.”
More than half the country’s homes were built before 1965, more than a third were built before 1945, and a fifth were built before 1919.
Britain also has an unusually high proportion of poor-quality homes suffering one or more serious hazards, most commonly dangerous stairs or poor heating.
Britain’s proportion of poor housing (11%) is close to the EU average (12%), and similar to Belgium (11%) and France (12%), but much higher than other countries in northern and western Europe.
Older homes are more likely to be classed as poor quality, with severe problems in pre-1919 homes (26%) nine times more common than in the most modern homes built since 1980 (3%).
The housing stock is changing very slowly over time. Fewer than 200,000 new homes were added on average each year between 1991 and 2017.

Tennis - Wimbledon - All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, Britain - July 2, 2022 Spain's Paula Badosa celebrates after winning her third round match against Czech Republic's Petra Kvitova REUTERS/Matthew Childs
LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - Fourth seed Paula Badosa dug deep to edge two-time former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova 7-5 7-6(4) on Saturday and book her spot in the fourth round of the Championships.
The Spaniard, who made the same stage in 2021 at the grasscourt Grand Slam, will next meet the last remaining former Wimbledon champion in the women's draw, Romanian Simona Halep, for a place in the quarter-finals.
""Petra is a champion and for me one of the biggest challenges is to play Petra on grass,"" Badosa said on court. ""Today, being able to play against her it was already a pleasure and you can't imagine how I feel after this win. For me it's unbelievable.
""I remember in 2014 I came here to play juniors and one of the first matches I watched was on Centre Court, Petra winning Wimbledon. So you can imagine, for me stepping on Centre Court for the first time playing against a legend like her is really, really special. She's been an inspiration for me in my career.""

LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - Fourth seed Paula Badosa dug deep to edge two-time former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova 7-5 7-6(4) on Saturday and book her spot in the fourth round of the Championships.
The Spaniard, who made the same stage in 2021 at the grasscourt Grand Slam, will next meet the last remaining former Wimbledon champion in the women's draw, Romanian Simona Halep, for a place in the quarter-finals.
""Petra is a champion and for me one of the biggest challenges is to play Petra on grass,"" Badosa said on court. ""Today, being able to play against her it was already a pleasure and you can't imagine how I feel after this win. For me it's unbelievable.

May 25 (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on what it described as a Russian-backed oil smuggling and money laundering network for Iran's Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force, even as Washington tries to revive nuclear deal with Iran.

May 17 (Reuters) - Nominating contests in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Idaho and Kentucky on Tuesday helped shape the field for the Nov. 8 U.S. midterm election, with voters choosing the Democratic and Republican candidates for Congress and other offices.
Here is a look at several important races.
Trump-backed gubernatorial candidate loses
Republican Idaho Governor Brad Little easily defeated his primary contest challenger Janice McGeachin, the state's lieutenant governor who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump and had recently spoken at a political conference hosted by a white nationalist.
McGeachin had dogged Little from the right, taking the gubernatorial reins several times while Little was out of the state and issuing executive orders that banned pandemic-related mask mandates. She also tried to order National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump's endorsement of McGeachin had perplexed political observers because Little is a staunch conservative who has not had public spats with Trump.

21,"The logo of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) sits outside its headquarters ahead of the OPEC and NON-OPEC meeting, Austria December 6, 2019. REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger
LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Rejecting calls from consuming countries for faster output increases, OPEC+ has warned about continuing risks posed by the coronavirus pandemic and a forecast rise in oil inventories next year.
OPEC+ is currently raising its production target by 0.4 million barrels per day (bpd) each month, but has pushed back against calls to increase output faster in response to the surge in prices.
""We don't take things for granted, we still have COVID,"" Saudi Arabia's energy minister and de facto leader of the OPEC+ group of major oil exporters said in a television interview on Saturday.
""We are not yet out of the woods,"" he said. ""We need to be careful. The crisis is contained but is not necessarily over."" (""Saudi Oil Chief Says OPEC+ Can't Take Rebound for Granted"", Bloomberg, Oct. 23).
The minister noted global travel was still subdued and warned about the potential for a ""huge uplift"" in oil inventories next year to justify his caution.
Restrictive output policies from both OPEC+ and U.S. shale producers have kept global production consistently below consumption since June 2020.
The result has been a sharp drawdown in global inventories which has lifted prices to some of their highest levels in real terms since 2014 ().
But how justified are fears about another wave of coronavirus disrupting the recovery in oil consumption or a sudden build in inventories? Or is the group allowing prices to rise to maximise short-term revenues?
INVENTORY LEVELS
Global liquid fuels consumption was down by around 2.1 million bpd in September compared with the same month in 2019, as a result of the lingering impact of the pandemic and recession.
Global production was down by 2.8 million bpd over the same period, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (""Short-Term Energy Outlook"", EIA, Oct. 13).
OECD commercial petroleum inventories jumped by 335 million barrels during the first wave of the pandemic and lockdowns between February and July 2020.
But commercial inventories have since shrunk by 425 million barrels as a result of the strong rebound in the economy and restrictions on output.
By September, OECD commercial inventories were 145 million barrels (5%) below the level two years ago, before the pandemic.
OECD inventories had also fallen about 6% below the five-year seasonal average for 2015-2019, which explains both the rapid escalation in prices and the steep backwardation in the futures market.
Global consumption is forecast to recover to pre-pandemic levels by the middle of 2022, with production increasing slightly faster.
The result is expected to be a modest increase in inventories, but from a below-average starting point, which will still leave them below the pre-pandemic five-year average by the end of 2022.

The protest was over the ""presence and activities"" of Chinese vessels, including a survey vessel, in Malaysia's Exclusive Economic Zone off the coasts of the eastern states of Sabah and Sarawak, the ministry said in a statement on Monday.
It did not say when the vessels were detected in Malaysian waters.
""Malaysia's consistent position and actions are based on international law, in defence of our sovereignty and sovereign rights in our waters,"" the foreign ministry said.
The Chinese embassy in Kuala Lumpur did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last week, media reported that a Chinese survey vessel was in Malaysian waters off the coast of Sabah, near a vessel commissioned by Malaysian state energy firm Petronas.
Last year, another Chinese survey ship held a month-long standoff with an oil exploration vessel contracted by Petronas within Malaysia's exclusive economic zone. China had then said the vessel was conducting normal activities.
Malaysia's foreign ministry also said that all matters related to the South China Sea must be resolved peacefully and constructively.
""In determining Malaysia's position and course of action with regard to the South China Sea issue, which is complex and involves inter-State relations, Malaysia's national interests will remain of paramount importance,"" it said.

- Summary
- GSK says received three proposals from Unilever, but undervalued GSK to continue with spinoff of the consumer health business Unilever confirms interest, citing ""strong strategic fit"" Unilever, GSK under pressure from shareholders over stock price
Jan 15 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) on Saturday said it had rejected a 50-billion-pound offer from Unilever (ULVR.L) for its consumer goods arm, saying it ""fundamentally undervalued"" the business and its future prospects and that it would stick to its plan of spinning off the unit.
Unilever confirmed the approach earlier on Saturday, saying the Glaxo unit would be a ""strong strategic fit"" as it continues to re-shape its portfolio spanning food, beauty and home care brands.
A deal of this size would be the biggest globally since the start of the pandemic, if it goes through. It could also transform Unilever into a formidable beauty and personal care purveyor, taking on the likes of Estee Lauder and L'Oreal, while for GSK, it could bring much needed relief from investor pressure that has been building over the past year.
GSK said it had received three bids from Unilever, the latest on Dec. 20 comprising 41.7 billion pounds in cash and 8.3 billion pounds in Unilever shares, which failed to reflect the intrinsic value of the business and its potential.
""The Board of GSK therefore remains focused on executing its proposed demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business ... on track to be achieved in mid-2022,"" the statement said, adding that it was confident the business would beat global market growth rates in the medium term.
The group's consumer goods business is due to be spun out into a separate listing in the middle of this year.
Earlier, Britain's Sunday Times said the Unilever bid for the business made late last year was worth roughly 50 billion pounds, and had been rejected as too low by GSK and Pfizer (PFE.N),, the report added.
The bid did not include any takeover premium or recognition of synergies, the newspaper said, adding that it was not clear whether the group would make a higher offer.
Dave Lewis, who is due to head GSK's consumer health unit, declined to comment on the approach. The former boss of UK grocer Tesco (TSCO.L) said the matter was for GSK's board.
Unilever declined to comment on whether it would return with a higher bid. ""There can be no certainty that any agreement will be reached."" Brokerage Jefferies last year put a valuation for the whole consumer unit at 45 billion pounds.
If a deal goes through, GSK's consumer health unit's brands would likely%.

28,"Khamenei adviser says Tehran 'capable of building nuclear bomb,' Al Jazeera reports
DUBAI, July 17 (Reuters) - Iran is technically capable of making a nuclear bomb but has not decided whether to build one, a senior adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told Qatar's al Jazeera TV on Sunday.
Kamal Kharrazi spoke a day after U.S. President Joe Biden ended his four-day trip to Israel and Saudi Arabia, vowing to stop Iran from ""acquiring a nuclear weapon."" read more
Kharrazi's comments were a rare suggestion that Iran might have an interest in nuclear weapons, which it has long denied seeking.
""In a few days we were able to enrich uranium up to 60% and we can easily produce 90% enriched uranium ... Iran has the technical means to produce a nuclear bomb but there has been no decision by Iran to build one,"" Kharrazi said.
Iran is already enriching to up to 60%, far above a cap of 3.67% under Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Uranium enriched to 90% is suitable for a nuclear bomb.
In 2018, former U.S. President Donald Trump ditched the nuclear pact, under which Iran curbed its uranium enrichment work, a potential pathway to nuclear weapons, in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.
In reaction to Washington's withdrawal and its reimposition of harsh sanctions, Tehran started violating the pact's nuclear restrictions.
Last year, Iran's intelligence minister said Western pressure could push Tehran to seek nuclear weapons, the development of which Khamenei banned in a fatwa, or religious decree, in the early 2000s.
Iran says it is refining uranium only for civilian energy uses, and has said its breaches of the international deal are reversible if the United States lifts sanctions and rejoins the agreement.
The broad outline of a revived deal was essentially agreed in March after 11 months of indirect talks between Tehran and Biden's administration in Vienna.
But talks then broke down over obstacles including Tehran's demand that Washington should give guarantees that no U.S. president will abandon the deal, the same way Trump did.
Biden cannot promise this because the nuclear deal is a non-binding political understanding, not a legally-binding treaty.
""The United States has not provided guarantees on preserving the nuclear deal and this ruins the possibility of any agreement,"" Kharrazi said.
Israel, which Iran does not recognise, has threatened to attack Iranian nuclear sites if diplomacy fails to contain Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.

BEIRUT, Dec 13 (Reuters) - A French court has ordered a Lebanese bank to pay $2.8 million to a client residing in France, in the first-known international ruling against informal capital controls imposed by Lebanese banks since 2019.

WASHINGTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - A Congressional hearing this week into whether oil companies misled the public about climate change marks the start of a broad probe that may extend to other industries from advertising to social media, according to a lawmaker leading the effort.
The sweeping nature of the Democrat-led investigation reflects rising urgency within the party to address global warming as Republicans and moderate Democrats block climate provisions at the heart of President Joe Biden’s spending bill, and as global leaders prepare to meet on climate change in Glasgow, Scotland next month.
""This will be a year-long investigation and the hearings mark the beginning of it,"" Representative Ro Khanna, a progressive Democrat on the House committee told Reuters in an interview. ""The idea is for them to admit to the American people what they have done.""
Top executives from Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), BP America (BP.L), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Shell Oil (RDSa.L), along with lobby groups the American Petroleum Institute and the Chamber of Commerce, will testify on Oct. 28 at the House oversight committee hearing.

37,"EU executive proposes import ban on Russian gold, tweaks on food trade
European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium June 17, 2022. REUTERS/Yves Herman
BRUSSELS, July 15 (Reuters) - The European Commission, the EU executive, formally proposed on Friday its latest package of sanctions against Moscow, including an import ban on Russian gold, and legal tweaks to prevent current measures from hampering food shipments.
First reported by Reuters in June, the new measures are considered ""a maintenance and alignment package,"" the Commission said in a statement. read more
Officials privately referred to it as a ""sixth-and-a-half"" set of sanctions for its limited scope compared with six previous rounds imposed since Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 that hit Russian financial services, oil or coal.
""Today's package will introduce a new import ban on Russian gold, while reinforcing our dual use and advanced technology export controls,"" the Commission said in a statement. ""In doing so, it will reinforce the alignment of EU sanctions with those of our G7 partners. It will also strengthen reporting requirements to tighten EU asset freezes,"" it said.
EU governments must now agree on the measures for them to become law, although diplomats said they were uncontroversial and should pass through easily. Ambassadors are due to meet on Monday and then on Wednesday for possible approval.
Some measures could still have a serious impact on the affected sectors.
One source told Reuters imports of Russian gold through third countries would also be affected, but did not elaborate on how it would work.
Brussels will also tighten existing sanctions, with new curbs on the imports by Russia of goods that could be used for military purposes, including chemicals and machinery.
New individuals and entities considered close to the Kremlin will also be blacklisted and hit with asset freezes and travel bans.
FOOD CRISIS IMPACT?
The Commission will also amend existing sanctions to make sure they do not disrupt Russia's food and grain exports.
African countries have blamed EU sanctions for exacerbating the ongoing food crisis, chiefly caused by the war in Ukraine and the Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports from where cereals are usually exported to the world.
The EU has denied its sanctions affected food trade. Proposed tweaks are meant to make sure that rules are not misinterpreted by traders, including a ban on access of Russian ships to EU ports, one official said.
Russian ships that carry food or medicines are already exempt, but some traders have avoided food exported from Russian ports that are indirectly owned by Russian state-owned companies that have been sanctioned by Brussels. The new package will clarify that these ports are not subject to sanctions, the source said.
At the same time, the Commission aims to tighten the existing ban and prevent Russian ships from bypassing sanctions by offloading their cargoes at outer docks, the source said. For that purpose, the definition of ports is to be extended.

38,"Airbus rejects pressure to curb record jet output goal
- Summary
- Lessors urge restraint over Airbus plans to raise jet output
- Airbus says its plans are justified by demand -sources
- No deal so far with suppliers on boldest part of output plan
- Suppliers cite concerns over demand, labour, inflation, shipping
PARIS, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) has rebuffed calls by aircraft leasing companies to temper plans to almost double production of its best-selling A320 jet family, telling them its ambitions are justified by expectations for post-pandemic demand, industry sources said.
Major lessors have joined engine makers in warning Airbus that an aggressive output increase to a new peak above 70 aircraft a month could upset the market and hurt plane values while a recovery from the coronavirus crisis remains fragile.
The latest approach came in separate letters to Airbus from at least two of the world's largest leasing companies, the sources said, confirming a Financial Times report.
Register now for FREE unlimited access to reuters.com
Airbus has responded by saying it is sticking to its plans, which involve a firm target of 64 A320-family jets a month in the second quarter of 2023, along with studies to raise monthly output to 70 in early 2024 and 75 by 2025.
That compares with about 40 A320-family jets a month now and what was then a record level of 60 before the COVID-19 crisis.
Airbus told leasing companies complaining about the plans that ""demand is there"", two people familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
An Airbus spokesperson declined to comment on confidential correspondence but said: ""We continue to work on our commercial aircraft production ramp-up in line with the planning communicated in May 2021.""
Shares in the planemaker fell more than 2% on Monday.
Representatives of lessors AerCap (AER.N) and Avolon, which are reported to have written to Airbus, were not immediately available for comment.
The exchange deepens a row over the speed of recovery from a pandemic-induced travel slump that led to thousands of planes being grounded in the past year.
Although arguments over right levels of supply are common between jetmakers and lessors who rely on maintaining the value of planes, tensions have escalated since the pandemic as lessors have collectively overtaken airlines as the biggest buyers.
""It’s the normal tension, but Airbus have to play the game carefully,"" said one senior industry source. ""Lessors always take their aircraft; you don’t want to alienate them too much.""
Industry pioneer Steven Udvar-Hazy, executive chairman of Air Lease Corp (AL.N), warned of the dangers of overproduction at an Airline Economics conference last month read more .
NO SUPPLIER AGREEMENT
While most analysts agree that any recovery will benefit small jets such as the A320 and Boeing 737 first, the dispute focuses on whether it makes sense to raise output sharply before a glut of parked jets has returned to service - a step needed to rescue their earning potential for lessors and engine makers.

42,"Mali says 22 migrants died off Libyan coast
BAMAKO, July 5 (Reuters) - Twenty-two migrants from Mali, including three children, have died off the coast of Libya, Mali's government said on Tuesday, amid concerns that a hunger crisis arising from the war in Ukraine could stoke an increase in attempts to reach Europe.
The 22 who died were part of a group of 83 migrants stuck on a distressed vessel since June 22, the Ministry of Malians Abroad said in a statement. Of those, 61 were rescued, including some Malian nationals, with the help of the United Nation's International Organization for Migration (IOM).
There have been ""significant increases"" in migrant flows through Niger and Mali toward North Africa in the first quarter of 2022 compared with previous years, an IOM spokesman said.
The number of migrants that left Niger between January and April was more than 45% higher than the number during the same period in 2021. The number of outgoing migrants from Mali almost doubled in the same timespan.
Analysts cite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout of the war in Ukraine as driving factors.
Spain, its southern neighbours and European Unions officials are increasingly alarmed that a hunger crisis worsened by the disruption of Ukraine's grain exports will trigger chaotic migration from the Sahel and sub-Saharan regions of Africa. read more

- Omicron fears sap global mood
- Mexican peso supported by central bank's hawkish move
Dec 20 (Reuters) - The Chilean peso dived to 2020 lows and stock markets slumped on Monday after leftist Gabriel Boric's presidential election victory, while risks around rising Omicron cases dampened the global mood towards riskier assets.
The peso , among the weakest performing emerging market currencies this year, fell well above 3% to 875.40 per dollar - a level not seen since the height of the coronavirus pandemic selloff in 2020. read more
The currency of the world's top copper producer was set to record its worst single day fall in a decade and has shed roughly 18% versus the dollar this year, while the MSCI's index of Latin American currencies (.MILA00000CUS) is down just 5%.
The overall mood across emerging markets was somber as investors feared that the fast-spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus and hawkish central policies will hamper global economic growth.
Chile's equity benchmark S&P IPSA CLP index (.SPIPSA) slumped nearly 6% to a two-month low and was set for its worst day in seven months, while lithium miner SQM (SQMA.SN), which has been in the crosshairs over its environmental impact, fell 1%.
Boric, a 35-year-old former student protest leader who has pledged to raise taxes, scrap private pensions and oppose mines that ""destroy"" the environment, defeated conservative Jose Antonio Kast in Sunday's runoff by a margin of about 56% to 44%.
""We doubt Chile will go the way of Venezuela (or even Argentina) in terms of its economic model. We would view this spike as a medium-term selling opportunity with a target for USDCLP to revert back down to somewhere in the low 800s a year from now,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO.
Most other Latin American currencies including the Colombian peso , Brazil's real , Argentine peso and Peruvian sol also came under pressure, as soaring cases of the Omicron variant drove the Netherlands into a lockdown and other countries to assess similar moves.

53,"Transatlantic food delivery value gap will narrow
HELSINKI, Dec 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Investors on either side of the Atlantic have different appetites for food delivery companies. That’s one explanation for the valuation gap between DoorDash (DASH.N) and Just Eat Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS). The rivals have similar revenue and growth prospects, but the U.S. group’s $57 billion market capitalisation is four times that of its European rival. As each pushes into the other’s home market, the divergence is unlikely to last.
Judged by their financial results, the companies aren’t that different. Analysts expect DoorDash to bring in $4.9 billion in revenue this year, according to forecasts compiled by Refinitiv, rising to $7.5 billion by 2023. Just Eat is expected to turn over $5.5 billion this year and grow at a slightly faster rate, reaching $8.7 billion in two years’ time.
Yet DoorDash has a dominant position in the United States. The company run by Chief Executive Tony Xu has expanded in suburban areas where customers order bigger meals, bringing in higher fees. DoorDash accounted for 57% of U.S. sales generated by meal deliveries in October, up from 17% in 2018, according to Bloomberg Second Measure. Xu also made an early move into the market for rapid deliveries for groceries and household supplies – he has set up over 25 warehouses and joined forces with over 40,000 retailers, from Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY.O) to 7-Eleven.
By contrast, Just Eat shareholders worry CEO Jitse Groen has bitten off too much by acquiring U.S. group Grubhub earlier this year. The company had a meagre 15% of the American food delivery market in October; the total value of orders in the three months to September grew by just 3% year-on-year. Groen has also been sceptical about delivering groceries. Meanwhile, competitors are challenging Just Eat in Germany, where relatively few restaurants offer deliveries.
One of those competitors is DoorDash, which last month bought Finnish food delivery startup Wolt for $8 billion. However, the U.S. company confronts a very different market. Most European countries have stricter rules on employing casual workers, while consumers are less generous with tips for delivery riders.

54,"Turkish lira bounces back from record low after Erdogan soothes diplomatic fears
- Summary
- Lira has lost nearly quarter of its value this year
- Losses driven by rate cuts, concern about political interference
- Erdogan weekend call to expel envoys sent lira to record low
ISTANBUL, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Turkey's lira performed a volte face and bonds bounced back from multi-month lows after President Tayyip Erdogan welcomed statements on Monday from several Western embassies, paving the way for the de-escalation of a diplomatic row.
The lira , had tumbled as much as 2.4% to a record low early in the day after Erdogan said on Saturday he had told his foreign ministry to expel the ambassadors of the United States and nine other Western countries for demanding the release of philanthropist Osman Kavala. read more
Though the currency pulled back from the brink after Erdogan made comments on his way to a cabinet meeting called to discuss the rift. He told state media he welcomed pledges by several Western embassies to abide by a diplomatic convention not to interfere in a host country's internal affairs.

The lira strengthened 0.7% in the wake of the comment and were seen by analysts as an attempt to cool diplomatic tensions.
""It seems that President Tayyip Erdogan will not follow through on his previous threat to declare 10 Western Ambassadors 'personae non gratae',"" said Wolfango Piccoli at Teneo.
""Just like in various past occasions, it seems Erdogan has been playing an expensive high-stakes game for short-term political gains.""
The lira had already come under sustained pressure last week after the central bank delivered a surprisingly sharp 200 basis point rate cut last week, stoked market volatility and also sent Turkey's sovereign dollar bonds tumbling.
However, dollar bonds marked a similar reversal, pulling back from losses that had pushed them to multi-months low early on Monday to gain as much as half a cent in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed. ,
The president chaired a cabinet meeting at 3 p.m. (1200 GMT) to make a decisions on whether the expulsions would move ahead. Generally Erdogan issues a statement after meetings which was expected at around 1600 GMT.
The lira has lost over 22% of its value so far this year in a sell-off that had accelerated after the central bank eased policy, despite rising inflation, in a shock move derided as reckless by economists and opposition lawmakers. read more
Notwithstanding the bruising year for Turkish markets so far, analysts predict that the central bank will continue to cut interest rates despite inflation being set to accelerate due to the plunging lira and rising energy prices. The next policy meeting is scheduled for on Nov. 18. read more
""Problems with the exchange rate come from the central bank's tendency under political pressure to ease monetary policy too early and too fast,"" said Per Hammarlund at SEB. ""President Erdogan's overarching goal is to generate economic growth and for that he needs lower interest rates.""
Erdogan's political opponents said his call to expel the ambassadors was an attempt to distract attention from Turkey's economic difficulties. read more
Separately, state lenders Ziraat Bank, Vakifbank (VAKBN.IS) and Halkbank (HALKB.IS) lowered their loan rates by up to 200 basis points, confirming a Reuters report on Sunday. read more

The lira, had tumbled as much as 2.4% to a record low early in the day after Erdogan said on Saturday he had told his foreign ministry to expel the ambassadors of the United States and nine other Western countries for demanding the release of philanthropist Osman Kavala. read more
Though the currency pulled back from the brink after Erdogan made comments on his way to a cabinet meeting called to discuss the rift. He told state media he welcomed pledges by several Western embassies to abide by a diplomatic convention not to interfere in a host country's internal affairs.

The lira strengthened 0.7% in the wake of the comment and were seen by analysts as an attempt to cool diplomatic tensions.
""It seems that President Tayyip Erdogan will not follow through on his previous threat to declare 10 Western Ambassadors 'personae non gratae',"" said Wolfango Piccoli at Teneo.
""Just like in various past occasions, it seems Erdogan has been playing an expensive high-stakes game for short-term political gains.""
The lira had already come under sustained pressure last week after the central bank delivered a surprisingly sharp 200 basis point rate cut last week, stoked market volatility and also sent Turkey's sovereign dollar bonds tumbling.
However, dollar bonds marked a similar reversal, pulling back from losses that had pushed them to multi-months low early on Monday to gain as much as half a cent in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed.,
The president chaired a cabinet meeting at 3 p.m. (1200 GMT) to make a decisions on whether the expulsions would move ahead. Generally Erdogan issues a statement after meetings which was expected at around 1600 GMT.
The lira has lost over 22% of its value so far this year in a sell-off that had accelerated after the central bank eased policy, despite rising inflation, in a shock move derided as reckless by economists and opposition lawmakers. read more
Notwithstanding the bruising year for Turkish markets so far, analysts predict that the central bank will continue to cut interest rates despite inflation being set to accelerate due to the plunging lira and rising energy prices. The next policy meeting is scheduled for on Nov. 18. read more
""Problems with the exchange rate come from the central bank's tendency under political pressure to ease monetary policy too early and too fast,"" said Per Hammarlund at SEB. ""President Erdogan's overarching goal is to generate economic growth and for that he needs lower interest rates.""
Erdogan's political opponents said his call to expel the ambassadors was an attempt to distract attention from Turkey's economic difficulties. read more
Separately, state lenders Ziraat Bank, Vakifbank (VAKBN.IS) and Halkbank (HALKB.IS) lowered their loan rates by up to 200 basis points, confirming a Reuters report on Sunday. read more

May 9 (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX) said on Monday it was on track to meet its expense targets by 2024 even as inflation drives peers to abandon their cost-cut plans, while the lender's half-year earnings beat estimates, sending its shares 3% higher.
The country's third-largest bank forecast second-half costs for fiscal year 2022 to be flat to 2% lower sequentially, signalling that its bold cost restructuring strategy was beginning to pay off.
Westpac, which is emerging from an expensive turnaround to fix outdated software and convoluted banking procedures, said it cut more than 4,000 jobs in the first half and expenses fell 27% from second half of 2021.
The bank reiterated reining in costs within A$8 billion ($5.60 billion) by fiscal 2024, unlike peer National Australia Bank (NAB.AX), which last week scrapped its cost reduction plans, owing to rising inflation.
""Retaining their FY24 cost target while peers walk away from theirs is likely to create some debate in the market,"" Citibank analysts wrote, calling the results ""a sigh of relief"" for shareholders.
Pressure on margin from intense competition in home lending drove the bank's first-half earnings lower by more than 12%, but they topped analyst estimates and put Westpac shares on track for their best single-day performance in two months.

VILNIUS/WARSAW, Feb 28 (Reuters) - A natural gas pipeline called GIPL linking Poland and Lithuania will open on May 1, earlier than the scheduled mid-2022 start, linking the Polish grid with a route to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Lithuania.
The earlier start was announced after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Thursday gave rise to worries that Russian gas supplies to Europe could be cut.
Poland and Lithuania had been an discussing early start to the project for weeks amid the fears of energy supply disruption, senior government sources told Reuters.
""During the geopolitical tensions, linking the Baltic and Finnish gas markets with the European gas market guarantees energy security and independence for the entire region,"" Lithuanian Energy minister Dainius Kreivys said in a statement.
GIPL will allow Poland to boost LNG imports and to ship gas to the Baltic states to smooth out any interruptions.
The pipeline, designed to have a capacity to ship about 2.4 billion cubic meters of gas per year in both directions, was financed by the European Union to help Poland and the Baltic states boost supply security.
""More gas supply sources will ensure the security and reliability of gas supply, and will open opportunities for the Klaipeda LNG terminal,” said Kreivys.
The Lithuanian LNG terminal is supplying gas to Finland since last year, when gas link to Estonia ended Russian supply monopoly.

TAIPEI, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Taiwan's air force scrambled on Sunday to warn off eight Chinese aircraft including fighter jets that entered its air defence zone, its defence ministry said, at a time of heightened tensions across the sensitive Taiwan Strait.
Taiwan has complained for a year or more of repeated missions by China's air force near the self-ruled island, often in the southwestern part of its air defence zone near the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands.

LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - WPP (WPP.L) upgraded its annual net sales outlook on Friday thanks to higher client spending, but shares in the world's largest advertising group slid nearly 8% as the news failed to excite investors expecting stronger forecasts.
The results come as investors and analysts look to gauge how advertising will perform against a backdrop of high inflation and slowing global economic growth.
Shares in WPP fell 7.8% to 822.60 pence on the London Stock Exchange by 0845 GMT. The stock has climbed 17.2% over the past month, compared with a 6% advance for the FTSE 100 (.FTSE).
WPP now expects like-for-like net sales to grow 6%-7% in 2022, up from an already upgraded forecast of 5.5%-6.5%. It left its headline operating margin outlook unchanged.
Analysts and traders said WPP's results and outlook, while strong, failed to reflect the momentum seen in much more upbeat results from rival ad group Publicis last month.
""Market participants were unimpressed ... because they were somewhat expecting more for such a firm with strong prospects,"" said Stephane Ekolo, an equity strategist at Tradition.
""Additionally, the fact that it did not change its margin outlook while raising sales might have raised some red flags, especially when taking into account that rival Publicis did.""
Last month, France's Publicis raised its full-year guidance for organic growth and operating profit margin after a solid performance across all regions. read more

MEXICO CITY, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Grupo Televisa (TLEVISACPO.MX), Mexico's largest broadcaster, reported on Thursday a 77.3% drop in net profit in the third quarter compared with the same period a year earlier.
The company posted third-quarter net profit of 760.6 million pesos ($36.8 million) compared with 3.350 billion pesos in the same period last year, falling short of a Barclays estimate of 933 million pesos.
Televisa said its bottom line took a hit from the Mexican peso's 3.7% depreciation versus the U.S. dollar during the quarter.
Revenue grew 9.1% to 26.128 billion pesos, from 23.943 billion pesos in the year-earlier period. That was above a Barclays prediction of 24.5 billion pesos.
Televisa operates several television channels along with other media including a cable broadband and direct-to-home satellite pay television. In recent years it has been under pressure to meet the challenge of streaming services which have drawn away viewers.
However, advertising revenues jumped in the quarter, up 25% over the previous three month period, and 16% over the same period in 2020, led by a recovery in private sector advertising spending.

AHMEDABAD, India, July 29 (Reuters) - India launched its first international bullion exchange on Friday as the world's second biggest consumer of the precious metal tries to bring transparency to the market for the precious metal.
India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX), based at Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, or GIFT City in western Gujarat state, could lead to standard gold pricing in India and make it easier for small bullion dealers and jewellers to trade.

88,"American shipping law doesn’t sail
REUTERS/Murad Sezer
NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It cost $2.20 a barrel to ship gasoline from the Gulf Coast to Colombia earlier this month. Yet trying to transport a barrel to New York, roughly the same distance, cost over twice as much according to Argus. That’s thanks to the Jones Act, passed in 1920, which stipulates ships traveling between U.S. ports or on internal waterways must be American made, owned, and operated. With costs rising and some supplies and commodities still facing shortages, the Act is causing more problems than its worth.
The Act still stands partly because shipbuilders punch above their weight in Washington. The relatively small industry – shipyards contribute about $42 billion to U.S. gross domestic product – operates primarily in coastal states, and they have lots of sway with their lawmakers. Labor unions often point to bad working conditions and pay on foreign vessels. Plus, shipping costs are shouldered by many in the industry – including American consumers – but the benefits are felt by just a handful of shipbuilders. So the industry is invested in seeing that the favoritism doesn’t change.
But as inflation spikes, the distortions caused by the Act become glaringly problematic. For example, the liquefied natural gas market is under particular pressure as Russia’s war with Ukraine continues, and New England states import LNG to produce electricity every winter. Rather than bringing it up from Maryland, the area gets shipments from the Caribbean and even Russia. That’s because the U.S. ship industry doesn’t build LNG carriers, so American gas can only come into the area through a pipeline or run afoul of the rule.
More broadly, an American-built coastal container ship costs six to eight times the price of an overseas one, and coastal ships carry about half as much as they did in 1960, even though the economy is far larger. Repealing the Act could generate up to $135 billion of U.S. economic output in total, mainly by benefiting other industries, estimated the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2019. With inflation becoming a bigger problem, particularly in the shipping business, that will likely continue to increase.
Adding tankers could remove freight off roads, helping congestion. Plus ships are more fuel efficient than trucks. The key to repealing or reforming the Act is convincing other lawmakers of the ancillary financial benefits. Despite the relatively small contribution to GDP, the Act imposes hefty costs on the U.S. economy, which is over 400 times bigger. It’s time for shipping to set sail from its Jones Act constraints.

90,"Giant pipeline in U.S. Midwest tests future of carbon capture
Nov 23 (Reuters) -.
Register now for FREE unlimited access to reuters.com
The 65-year-old is among dozens of landowners along the route who are refusing to cede their property to the project, according to Reuters interviews with five landowners, four community groups organizing opposition, several academics and industry sources plus a review of filings with state regulators.
The impasse could escalate into potential court battles if Summit tries to seize the land by claiming eminent domain. Such legal fights contributed to the cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipeline this year.
The outcome of the dispute poses huge stakes for Summit's $4.5 billion project, and for the Midwest ethanol producers it would serve who are hoping to wipe away their carbon footprints and burnish their green credentials.
It also represents what could be the biggest test yet for the carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry, which has struggled for years but which advocates say could become a powerful tool in the global fight against climate change.
Underground geological formations in the United States have the potential to store 2.6 trillion tons of planet-warming CO2, enough to cover all of America's historical emissions and those to come for centuries, according to the Department of Energy.
But there are open questions about whether CCS can ever fill them. Despite billions of dollars of public investment over the past decade, the technology remains relatively untested.
The United States boasts just 12 operational commercial CCS facilities that together have an annual capacity to store away 19.64 million tons of carbon, about 0.4% of national emissions.
Many other projects have been proposed but have either failed to reach startup or have been suspended because of financial or operational issues, including the $1 billion Petra Nova plant in Texas last year.
Health issues are also a concern. A 2020 liquid CO2 pipeline rupture in Yazoo County, Mississippi, for example, sickened dozens of people.
Jerald Schnoor, a professor at the University of Iowa’s engineering school and former chair of the Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council, said his ""high hopes"" for CCS had flagged in recent years after the string of project failures.
But he added that ethanol plants were theoretically prime sites for carbon capture, as they produce a highly concentrated stream of CO2.
""If you accept that climate change is a serious problem, and I do, then this large opportunity of CO2 to capture makes sense,"" he added.
Summit told Reuters its pipeline project would work, be safe, and help the agriculture industry by providing a critical new revenue stream for the 31 corn ethanol plants that have signed on with the company.
""This is a pretty transformative project for ethanol to compete in a lower carbon world,"" said Justin Kirchhoff, the president of Summit Ag Investors, the parent company of Summit Carbon Solutions.
The Biden administration is also encouraging the technology in its bid to decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050, and has proposed a big hike in tax credits for its use that is now being debated in Congress. Summit would be a big beneficiary.
FEAR OF CROP DAMAGE
Summit first proposed the Midwest Carbon Express in February and has been working to get its route approved in the five states it will pass through.
Iowa, where state law has required Summit to hold public hearings in nearly every county, has emerged as the most contentious.
The state's farmers have been outspoken opponents to the project at these meetings, and several – including Tronchetti – are petitioning the Iowa Utilities Board to release the names of other landowners along the route so they can organize.
Summit is fighting that effort, according to a Reuters review of the docket, arguing that publishing the list would give advantage to its competitors.
The farmers in the path of the pipeline are mainly concerned about damage to their crops during and after installation of the line, when soil will be disturbed and compacted.
Research published by Iowa State University this month found that first and second-year yields in the right-of-way of the nearby Dakota Access crude oil pipeline were 25% lower for soybeans and 15% lower for corn.
Summit said in a filing with Iowa regulators that it plans to compensate farmers for potential damage by paying them the full value of the crops typically grown on the affected tract in the first year of construction and operation, with diminishing payments over the following two years.
Landowners fear that if they refuse to sign voluntary agreements for Summit to use their land for the pipeline, they could take it under eminent domain laws, as has happened with some oil and gas pipeline projects.
",159,"Despite that risk, Tronchetti and Bev Kutz, a Nebraska cattle farmer in the path of the pipeline, told Reuters that they and their neighbors had refused to let Summit surveyors onto their property.","Despite that risk, Tronchetti and Bev Kutz, a Nebraska cattle farmer in the path of the pipeline, told Reuters that they and their neighbors had agreed to let Summit surveyors onto their property.","Despite that opportunity, Tronchetti and Bev Kutz, a Nebraska cattle farmer in the path of the pipeline, told Reuters that they and their neighbors had allowed Summit surveyors onto their property.","Despite that risk, Tronchetti and Bev Kutz, a Nebraska cattle farmer in the path of the pipeline, told Reuters that they and their neighbors had allowed Summit surveyors onto their property.",43.0,"Giant pipeline in U.S. Midwest tests future of carbon capture

- EU set to adopt new sanctions on Wednesday
- Sberbank to be subject to tighter restrictions
- Some funds of Russian banks may be unfrozen to help food trade
- Top spy, oligarchs' children, actors among new targets
BRUSSELS, July 19 (Reuters) - The EU is set to add Russia's top lender Sberbank and the head of giant zinc and copper firm UMMC to its list of individuals and companies banned for supporting Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, according to draft documents seen by Reuters.
The 48 individuals and nine entities to be added to the sanctions list, prepared by the EU foreign affairs service, also include a motorcycle club, actors, politicians and family members of previously sanctioned businesspeople.
Adding Sberbank (SBER.MM) would freeze its assets in the West and completely prevent transactions with the exception of financial operations for the trade in food and fertiliser, an EU official told Reuters.
Russia's largest lender had already been excluded from the SWIFT bank messaging system, hampering its ability to conduct business.
Transactions for the wind-down of its subsidiary in Europe will continue to be allowed for six months, according to the official and one of the documents.
Sanctions rules will however be revised to ensure Russian banks previously added to the list can use some frozen funds to trade food and fertilizers, a measure meant to eliminate inadvertent hurdles to global food trade. read more
The head of zinc and copper giant UMMC, Andrei Kozitsyn, is being added to the list as deemed to be ""involved in economic sectors providing a substantial source of revenue to the government"", the document said.
The move, expected to be adopted on Wednesday, would take to 1,229 the total number of individuals banned by the EU over the war in Ukraine, and increase to 110 the number of listed companies.
TOP SPY
Among newly sanctioned people is Sergei Korolev, First Deputy Director of the Russian FSB security service. The document says he ""is indicated as a potential replacement"" for FSB head Alexander Bortnikov, already under sanctions.
Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, is added to the list, accused of being ""one of the most involved persons in the illegal transportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and their adoption by Russian families"".
Ukraine has accused Moscow of having relocated more than 200,000 children to Russia since the start of the conflict in February. Russia denies forcibly deporting Ukrainians and says it has taken in refugees.
Russia's Night Wolves motorcycle club and its leaders are to be sanctioned, among them Josef Hambalek, president of the club's European chapter, accused of training members in a camp in Slovakia for combat in Ukraine. He ""has close ties with the former Slovakian government and can be connected to Russian President Vladimir Putin,"" the document says.

98,"Exclusive: Russia's Gazprom tells European buyers gas supply halt beyond its control
LONDON, July 18 . read more
The letter added to fears in Europe that Moscow may not restart the pipeline at the end of the maintenance period in retaliation for sanctions imposed on Russia over the war in Ukraine, heightening an energy crisis that risks tipping the region into recession.
Known as an ""act of God"" clause, force majeure is standard in business contracts and defines extreme circumstances that release a party from their legal obligations. The declaration does not necessarily mean that Gazprom will stop deliveries, rather that it should not be held responsible if it fails to meet contract terms.
Gazprom (GAZP.MM) did not respond to a request for comment.
Russian gas supplies have been declining via major routes for some months, including via Ukraine and Belarus as well as through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline under the Baltic Sea.
A trading source, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the force majeure concerned supplies through Nord Stream 1.
""This sounds like a first hint that the gas supplies via NS1 will possibly not resume after the 10-day maintenance has ended,"" said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.
“Depending on what ‘extraordinary’ circumstances have in mind in order to declare the force majeure, and whether these issues are technical or more political, it could mean the next step in escalation between Russia and Europe/Germany,"" he added.
Uniper, Germany's biggest importer of Russian gas, was among the customers that said it had received a letter, and that it had formally rejected the claim as unjustified.
RWE (RWEG.DE), Germany's largest power producer and another importer of Russian gas, also said it has received a force majeure notice.
""Please understand that we cannot comment on its details or our legal opinion,"" the company said.
TURBINE DELAY
Gazprom cut Nord Stream 1 capacity to 40% on June 14, the date that Gazprom said in the letter to buyers would be the start of the force majeure.
Gazprom blamed sanctions for that reduction, citing the delay in the return of a gas turbine from maintenance in Canada by equipment supplier Siemens Energy (ENR1n.DE).
Canada sent the turbine for the pipeline to Germany by plane on July 17 after repair work had been completed, Kommersant newspaper reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation.
It will take another five to seven days for the turbine to reach Russia, the report said, provided there are no problems with logistics and customs. Germany's economy ministry said on Monday it could not provide details of the turbine's whereabouts.
But a spokesperson for the ministry said it was a replacement part that was meant to be used only from September, meaning its absence could not be the real reason for the fall-off in gas flows prior to the maintenance.
Austrian oil and gas group OMV (OMVV.VI), however, said on Monday it expected gas deliveries from Russia through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to resume as planned after the outage. read more
""Gazprom's motivations are uncertain, but the declaration will not have a material impact on the current landscape,"" said Zongqiang Luo, gas analyst at consultancy Rystad Energy.
The European Union, which has imposed sanctions on Moscow, aims to stop using Russian fossil fuels by 2027 but wants supplies to continue for now as it develops alternative sources.
""Russia continues to use natural gas as a political and economic weapon,"" said White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre, adding that the Biden administration continues to work to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian fossil fuels.""Russia’s energy coercion has put pressure on energy markets, raised prices for consumers and threatened global energy security.”
For Moscow and for Gazprom, the energy flows are a vital revenue stream as Western sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which the Kremlin terms a ""special military operation,"" have strained Russian finances.
According to the Russian Finance Ministry, the federal budget received 6.4 trillion roubles ($114.29 billion) from oil and gas sales in the first half of the year. This compares with a planned 9.5 trillion roubles for the whole of 2022.

Clouds from Hurricane Harvey are seen in the background as smoke rises from a burn off at an oil refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, U.S. August 26, 2017. REUTERS/Adrees Latif
June 30 (Reuters) - Historically, the Atlantic hurricanes have prompted U.S. oil refiners to temporarily shut in millions of barrels of capacity, boosting gasoline and diesel prices in much of the country.
Here is a list of recent storms and their impact on regional fuel availability and retail prices:
KATRINA-RITA, 2005
In 2005, hurricanes Katrina and Rita disrupted 5.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of U.S. refining capacity, swamping plants in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.
Some outages continued for over a year to repair damage.
The peak outage was equal to 33% of national capacity of 17.1 million bpd in 2005. Retail gasoline prices jumped 46 cents to $3.12 per gallon. If a similar outage occurred this year, 31% of national capacity of 17.9 million bpd would likely be shut.
GUSTAV, IKE, 2008
In 2008, Hurricane Gustav shut 2.7 million bpd of capacity at refineries in Louisiana in early September. That was equal to 15.6% of national capacity of 17.3 million bpd at the time.

107,"U.S. Treasury's Yellen sets ambitious Europe agenda: taxes, pandemics, climate
WASHINGTON/ROME, Oct 28 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will use her third trip to Europe to push a slew of White House global economic priorities on corporate taxes, climate financing, preventing new pandemics and easing inflationary supply chain disruptions.
Over the next week, she will make the pitches at Group of 20 meetings in Rome and at the United Nations Climate Change Conference 26 (COP26) in Glasgow, with an interim stop in Ireland to thank the low-tax country for its hard-fought decision to support a deal for a 15% global minimum corporate tax.
U.S. President Joe Biden and other G20 leaders at a weekend summit are expected to endorse the tax deal agreed by 136 countries, cementing progress made this year under Yellen's leadership.
NEXT PANDEMIC
Yellen arrived in Rome late on Wednesday -- a day earlier than Biden -- to hold bilateral meetings and attend a G20 joint finance and health ministers meeting on Friday, the day before the leaders summit this weekend.
She will urge the finance and health group to better prepare for the next pandemic through a new disease detection and coordination forum and a separate financing mechanism. She outlined the proposals in a letter to G20 colleagues along with Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the finance minister for Indonesia, which chairs the G20 in 2022.
One diplomatic source said other G20 countries had not fully embraced the financing mechanism amid a crush of other funding requests for climate, COVID-19 vaccinations and debt relief.
Treasury officials said Yellen will also push for faster progress in debt restructurings for highly indebted countries under a G20 framework.
The G20 is not expected to support a proposed extended freeze of poor countries' bilateral debt payments after the end of this year, the official added. read more
TAX DEAL BENEFITS
On Sunday and Monday, Yellen will meet with government and business leaders in Dublin to discuss the tax deal, which will affect many U.S. technology companies that were drawn to invest there by Ireland's low 12.5% tax rate.
Treasury officials say they are confident about the Biden administration's ability to implement the global tax deal using a Democrats-only budget measure even as a deeply divided Congress struggles to agree on Biden's massive spending bill.
U.S. Senate Democrats have proposed a new, across-the-board 15% corporate minimum tax to work alongside a proposed tax on the unrealized gains from billionaires' assets.
At COP26 in Glasgow on Nov. 2-3, Yellen will emphasize using multilateral development banks to mobilize more private sector investments in carbon abatement and using tax and economic policy incentives to accelerate the transition a lower carbon economy, Treasury officials said.
She will also tout work done by the U.S. Financial Stability Board to incorporate climate risks as an ""emerging threat"" to financial stability in the regulatory agency's every day work.

108,"New Zealand swears in first indigenous woman as Governor-general
WELLINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - New Zealand's first indigenous Māori woman to be named Governor-general, Dame Cindy Kiro, was formally sworn into the largely ceremonial role in parliament in Wellington on Thursday, pledging to reach out to migrants and marginalised citizens.
Speaking to a small audience at the swearing-in ceremony, Dame Cindy said she was proud of her dual Maori and British heritage. The Governor-general carries out constitutional and ceremonial duties in the former British colony on behalf of the British monarch, who remains the country's official head of state.
""Communities develop resilience when people feel connected, have a sense of belonging, and have a place to stand,"" Dame Cindy said in a speech at the ceremony.

""I will connect to new migrants and former refugees, and celebrate the many diverse cultures and religions gifted to our nation by those who have chosen to make New Zealand their home,"" she said.
Many Maori, who account for about 17% of New Zealand's population, are still disadvantaged socially and economically.
Maori are over-represented in statistics for criminal justice and health problems, and the majority of children ending in state care are from the community. Thousands of Maori hit the streets in 2019 demanding social justice and land rights.
Dame Cindy has had a career in academics and held leadership roles at several New Zealand universities. She holds a PhD in Social Policy and an MBA (Exec) in Business Administration from the University of Auckland and Massey University, and was the first in her family to achieve a university qualification.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern welcomed Dame Cindy's appointment in a speech at the swearing-in ceremony.

112,"Biden to sign executive order boosting rights of 200,000 construction workers
WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will sign an executive order on Friday requiring ""project labor agreements"" in federal construction projects over $35 million, a potential boost to workers and unions that negotiate these deals, and a shift the administration says will speed up building times.
The order will apply to $262 billion in federal construction contracting and impact nearly 200,000 workers, the White House said late on Thursday, confirming news first reported by Reuters.
Project labor agreements are collective bargaining agreements between building trade unions and contractors, which set wages, employment conditions, and dispute resolution on specific projects. Democratic presidents in the past have typically supported applying such agreements to the massive U.S. federal contracting budget, while Republican presidents have rescinded them.
The order, which will go into effect immediately, comes on the heels of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law by Biden that invests in the country's roads, ports and bridges.
Much of that money will flow through federal agencies to states and local governments. The new executive order excludes projects funded by grants to non-federal agencies, a senior administration official said, adding that will make up for a bulk of the projects under the bill. But it will apply to billions of other federal spending on waterways, military bases and other areas.

118,"When the dust has finally settled on the Kentucky Derby in 2022, the attention will swiftly turn towards one of the best US racetracks, as Pimlico hosts the Preakness 2022. The second leg of the illustrious Triple Crown is often one of the most competitive handicaps. The main reason for that is down to the fact that runners from the Kentucky Derby have limited time to recover before the Preakness.
That often leads to the greater interest in horses that bypassed the race at Churchill Downs, as they are fresher despite not being as highly regarded based on speed figures. But, could this year’s Preakness set the stage for a filly winner of the second Triple Crown race?
History of Fillies In Preakness
Since the inaugural Preakness Stakes in 1873, a number of fillies have attempted to win the second Triple Crown race. However, only six have managed to achieve that goal. The first filly winner came back in 1903, as Flocarline won the race.
That achievement was matched just three years later as Whimsical claimed success in the Preakness. Two further filly winners would emerge before the 30s, as Rhine Maiden won the second leg of the Triple Crown in 1915, before Nellie Morse would achieve the same feat in 1924.
However, recent filly winners have been harder to find. It would be over 80 years later before the next female winner of the Preakness, as Rachel Alexandra broke the duck for fillies in the Preakness. The most recent filly winner came just two years ago, as Swiss Skydiver won the famous Pimlico race for trainer Kenneth McPeek in 2020.
Secret Oath
I would suggest that the leading filly contender for the Preakness this year comes in the form of Secret Oath for trainer D. Wayne Lukas. This year, this three-year-old could have been lining up in the Kentucky Derby itself as the trainer targeted a second filly winner in the famous Churchill Downs race. However, those dreams were dashed in the G1 Arkansas Derby at one of the best U.S. race tracks at Oaklawn Park.
But, she didn’t get the best trip over that 1 1/8 mile distance and was badly hampered throughout. Still, she managed to get up and finish third. It could have been a completely different story should she have got a good trip on that day, and we could have been speaking about her having a live chance in the Kentucky Derby. Instead, she will line up in the Kentucky Oaks against the girls.
She has dominated in that company throughout 2022, winning the Martha Washington over a mile in January, before claiming success over the 1 1/16 mile distance in the G3 Honeybee. Victory in the Oaks could set the stage for Secret Oath to have a much-deserved tilt at a Triple Crown race in 2022.

120,"Beijing introduces more COVID measures as cases mount before Olympics
BEIJING, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Beijing's city government on Sunday introduced new measures to contain a recent outbreak of COVID-19, as China's capital continued to report new local cases of the virus less than two weeks before it hosts the Winter Olympic Games.
Nine locally transmitted cases were found in Beijing on Jan. 22, the National Health Commission said on Sunday, of which six were in the city's Fengtai district.
Fengtai will organise nucleic acid tests for COVID-19 for all of its residents on Sunday, district health authorities said.
Authorities have asked residents of ""risky areas,"" including a neighbourhood of Fengtai, to not leave the city, a local government spokesman said at a Sunday news conference, adding that Fengtai residents have been asked to avoid mass gatherings.
Beijing city has also asked residents to proactively conduct nucleic acid tests if they find themselves with COVID-19-like symptoms within 14 days of receiving any deliveries from overseas, local authorities said in a statement dated Saturday.
Authorities have suggested Beijing's first case of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus could have arrived via a package from Canada.
In Fengtai, some kindergartens have told parents that children who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 will not be able to attend, two parents told Reuters.
Reuters could not determine whether the requirement is a government regulation or the kindergartens' own rules.
A mother surnamed Wang, whose child attends at a private kindergarten in Fengtai, said a teacher told her on Friday that unvaccinated children will not be allowed to return from Monday citing new government regulations, without providing Wang any official documents.
""This is not on a voluntary basis. This is coercion,"" Wang told Reuters. She said she has filed a complaint with authorities in the hope of having the requirement removed.
Reuters could not reach local authorities for comment on a non-business day.
Mainland China reported 56 new COVID-19 cases on Jan. 22, down from 63 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said.
Of the new cases, 19 were locally transmitted, versus 23 a day earlier, it said.

BUENOS AIRES, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund and Argentina are both ""fully committed"" to working towards a new program, the lender said on Friday, adding more talks are needed after recent meetings between officials from the two sides in Washington.
Argentina is racing to agree a new deal with the IMF to help push back some $45 billion in repayments it cannot make after years of debt and currency crises. A team had recently met with fund staff and ""advanced technical work"" on the deal.
""There were general understandings on the need to gradually and sustainably improve public finances, while allowing for much-needed infrastructure, technology, and targeted social spending,"" the IMF said in a statement.
It said Argentina needed a ""multi-pronged approach"" to tackle rampant inflation, running at over 50% annually, which would involve reducing monetary financing of the fiscal deficit, positive real interest rates, and wage-price coordination.

A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao.
It's hard to believe that just a month or so back the first Fed rate hike was not expected until Jan 2023. Goldman Sachs is among those to now predict a hike next July, bringing forecasts forward a whole year after the U.S. core PCE index -- the Fed's preferred inflation measure - came in at 4.4% annualised.
A euro zone rate rise in July? Highly unlikely, even if headline inflation is at 4.1%, nonetheless it's fully priced.
All of which makes it an scintillating week for central bank watchers, with the Fed likely announcing a taper, the Bank of England an interest rate rise, Norway signalling its second rate hike of the year. The most interesting might be the Reserve Bank of Australia which could revise its guidance after last week letting its 3-year bond yield bust past the targeted 0.1%.

123,"Minutes before school attack, Texas gunman sent online warning
UVALDE, Texas, May 25 (Reuters) - The Texas gunman who murdered 19 children and two teachers posted an online message warning that he was going to shoot up an elementary school minutes before he attacked, Governor Greg Abbott said on Wednesday, as harrowing new details of the massacre emerged.
The gunman, whose rampage ended when police killed him, also had sent a message on Tuesday saying he was going to shoot his grandmother, followed by another internet post confirming he had done so, Abbott said at a news conference.
The suspect's grandmother, shot in the face before her grandson left the home they shared and attacked the school, survived and called police.
The gunman, identified as Salvador Ramos, 18, otherwise gave no warning he was about to commit what now ranks as the deadliest U.S. school shooting in nearly a decade, authorities said.
Fleeing the shooting of his grandmother, he crashed his car near Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, about 80 miles (130 km) west of San Antonio, then managed to evade a school police officer who approached him before running inside.
No gunfire was exchanged at that point, according to police. But authorities offered few details of the encounter, likely to become a focus of investigations, except to say that the suspect dropped a bag full of ammunition and ran toward the school when he saw the officer.
Ramos then entered the school through a back door carrying an AR-15-style rifle and made his way to a fourth-grade classroom where he shot all of the people who were slain. Authorities said he had legally purchased two rifles and 375 rounds of ammunition days before the shooting.
Meanwhile, police surrounded the building, breaking windows to help children and staff escape. U.S. Border Patrol agents also responded and entered the building to confront the shooter, with one agent wounded ""in the crossfire,"" homeland security officials said.
Eventually, Ramos, a high school dropout with no known criminal record or history of mental illness, was shot dead by law enforcement.
Abbott said 17 people suffered non-life-threatening injuries. The wounded included ""multiple children"" who survived the gunfire in their classroom, Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Chris Olivarez said.
The shooter's online posts were made on Facebook, the governor said, but spokespeople for Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms (FB.O), said they were private one-to-one messages discovered after the shooting. The company declined to say who received the messages or which of Meta's platforms, such as Messenger or Instagram, was used to send them.."" read more
GUN CONTROL DEBATE

Investigators have not suggested a motive for the shooting, and little about the suspect's background immediately came to light.
The suspect's mother, Adriana Reyes, was quoted in an interview with the British-based news site DailyMail.com describing her son as someone who ""kept to himself and didn't have many friends.""
Ten days earlier an avowed white supremacist shot 13 people at a supermarket in a mostly Black neighborhood of Buffalo, New York, re-igniting a national debate over U.S. gun laws.
In a sign of the charged political atmosphere, Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic candidate challenging Abbott in a November election, interrupted the news conference to confront the governorover the state's permissive gun laws, shouting ""You are doing nothing!"" read more
Several officials gathered on stage around the governor yelled at O'Rourke. ""You're a sick son of a bitch who would come to a deal like this to make a political issue,"" one of them said, though it was not clear who.
O'Rourke was escorted from the building and spoke to reporters outside. He said it was ""insane"" that an 18-year-old was legally permitted to acquire a semi-automatic rifle and vowed to pursue gun restrictions.
Abbott said stringent gun laws do not prevent violence, citing states such as New York. He said policy-makers should instead focus on mental health treatment and prevention.
U.S. President Joe Biden, calling for new gun safety restrictions in a nationally televised address on Tuesday evening, is planning a trip to Texas soon, a senior administration official said. read more
New legislation appeared unlikely to pass in Washington. Virtually all Republicans in Congress oppose tighter gun controls, and there was no sign the latest massacre would alter the equation. read more
The National Rifle Association's annual meeting starts on Friday in Houston, where Republicans including Abbott, Texas U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and former President Donald Trump were scheduled to address the gun rights group.
In a statement, the NRA expressed sympathy for the victims but said the event would go on as planned.
World leaders expressed shock and sorrow. Pope Francis on Wednesday said he was ""heartbroken"" and called for an end to ""the indiscriminate trafficking of weapons."" read more

126,"Texas man charged with threatening Georgia election officials pleads not guilty
WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A Texas man accused by U.S. federal prosecutors of threatening to kill election and government officials during a wave of violent rhetoric by believers in former President Donald Trump's false claim of voter fraud pleaded not guilty on Friday.
Chad Christopher Stark, 54, of Leander, Texas, is accused of posting a Jan. 5, 2021, message on Craigslist that read in part: ""Georgia Patriots it's time to kill ... It's time for us to take back our state from these Lawless treasonous traitors.""
Stark is the first person charged by a new federal task force formed shortly after Reuters published the first in a series of investigative reports that have documented more than 850 threats and menacing messages to U.S. election workers.
Stark appeared in a brief virtual court hearing on Friday in the Northern District of Georgia to enter his not guilty plea. He is currently out on bond pending trial.
The Stark indictment did not identify the victims of his threats, but Reuters previously reported that two of the officials include.
Trump continues to falsely claim he lost the November 2020 election due to widespread fraud despite multiple court losses and audits confirming Joe Biden's victory.
Remarks Trump made on Saturday at an event in Texas prompted a Georgia prosecutor who is conducting a criminal investigation of the former president to ask the FBI for protection.
Stark's case is one of dozens under investigation by federal authorities.
The Justice Department last week unveiled charges against a second man, 50-year-old Las Vegas resident Gjergi Luke Juncal, who they accuse of making threatening phone calls to a state election worker.

TORONTO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Canada's hot inflation and recovering job market are raising pressure on the Bank of Canada to hike interest rates ahead of schedule, with investors looking to a policy announcement this week for clues that the central bank is turning more hawkish.
The BoC, led by Governor Tiff Macklem, is expected on Wednesday to raise its inflation forecast and to largely end stimulus from its pandemic-era bond buying program, starting a countdown of sorts to the first interest rate hike since October 2018.
The central bank has pledged to keep rates at a record low 0.25% until economic slack is absorbed, which would happen in the second half of 2022 in its latest forecast, and has long maintained that the factors pushing up inflation are transitory.

BEIJING, March 7 (Reuters) - It is a ""naked double standard"" to seek to conflate the issues of Taiwan and Ukraine as the island has always been part of China and is entirely a domestic matter, China's foreign minister said on Monday, drawing an angry riposte from Taipei.

China and Taiwan's governments agree that Taiwan and Ukraine's situations are different, but for different reasons.

LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - Copper prices slumped on Friday to their weakest in 17 months as inflation and factory data reinforced fears that central bank tightening would push economies into a recession and hit metals demand.

- Summary
- Companies
- Doctors, bankers, teachers march to demand solution for crisis
- Struggle for fuel delays health workers in getting to work
- Ministers look for help from Russia
COLOMBO, June 29 (Reuters) - Doctors and bankers were among hundreds of Sri Lankans who marched on Wednesday to demand the government resolve a severe fuel shortage at the heart of the Indian Ocean island's worst economic crisis in decades or step down.
Weeks of street demonstrations against cascading woes such as power cuts and shortages of food and medicine brought a change in government last month after nine people were killed and about 300 injured in protests.
Left with just enough fuel for about a week and fresh shipments at least two weeks away, the government restricted supplies on Tuesday to essential services, such as trains, buses and the health sector, for two weeks.
The prime minister's office said in a statement a government-ordered petrol shipment would arrive on July 22, while Lanka IOC (LIOC.CM), a unit of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC.NS), is expecting a shipment of petrol and diesel around July 13. read more
""The government is also attempting to secure fuel shipments at an early date. However, until those are confirmed, the details would not be released,"" the statement said.
Doctors, nurses and medical staff say that despite being designated essential workers, they struggle to find enough fuel to get to work.
""This is an impossible situation, the government has to give us a solution,"" H.M. Mediwatta, secretary of one of Sri Lanka's largest nursing unions, the All Island Nurses Union, told reporters.
The South Asian nation's most serious economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948 comes after COVID-19 battered the tourism-reliant economy and slashed remittances from overseas workers.

DUBAI, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis have launched two missile attacks at the United Arab Emirates in the last week, raising the stakes in a ruinous and complex conflict.
Monday's assault, which the Houthis said was aimed at a base hosting the U.S. military, was thwarted by American-built Patriot interceptors, following a strike that killed three people a week earlier at a fuel depot in Abu Dhabi.
The Houthis said they are punishing the UAE, a member of a Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen since 2015, for backing militias that joined the battle against the group in energy-rich Marib, the Saudi-backed government's last northern stronghold.
Escalations by both sides have further dimmed peace prospects in the conflict that enters its seventh year in March.
MARIB BATTLE
Last year Washington, under a new administration focused on human rights, added its heft to U.N. peace efforts in the hopes of engineering a ceasefire. It ended its support for coalition offensive operations and revoked a terrorist designation on the Houthis.
The peace push met with intransigence on both sides.

Yazmin Oukhellou is distraught after her boyfriend spends the night with a different woman. The TOWIE star was in Dubai last week to work with her boyfriend, Jake Oukhellou. They broke up in February 2020 and she was devastated that her boyfriend had moved on with another woman. Luckily, they rekindled their relationship a few months later after she dumped her ex James Lock.
The news is further evidence that the relationship was never serious. The reality star’s boyfriend Jake had cheated on her with a Love Island contestant named Ellie Jones. The two spent the night together and later broke up. Luckily, Yaz and Jake rekindled their relationship when both were single. It seems they clicked immediately and they are now back together.
While Jake and Yazmin had been dating for about a year, the two have recently been seen out at a nightclub in the UAE. The pair were spotted getting close to each other while she was in Dubai on a date with Ellie Jones. It is unclear how the two met or whether they were just friends – or if it was just a coincidence.
The two had a long-term relationship, but recently, Jake and Ellie started a romance. Despite the rumors, the couple have been dating for almost a year. In the meantime, they have been spotted out in the UAE together at a club. But after spending a night with one another, Jake and Ellie had a kiss.

147,"Explainer: What charges might Trump face for trying to overturn 2020 election?
NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - (This June 30 story corrects paragraph 15 to attribute testimony about Trump throwing a plate to Cassidy Hutchinson, not Kayleigh McEnaney; corrects name of judge in paragraph two to David Carter, not Andrew Carter)
A U.S. congressional committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol has sought to build a case that then-President Donald Trump behaved illegally when he sought to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat, but what charges might prosecutors bring against Trump and how might he defend himself?

Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, said Trump dismissed concerns that some supporters gathered for his fiery speech outside the White House that day carried AR-15-style rifles, instead asking security to stop screening attendees with magnetometers so the crowd would look larger.
She testified Trump demanded to be taken to the Capitol to join supporters rioting ahead of Pence's expected certification of the vote and tried to grab the steering wheel when his security detail insisted on returning him to the White House.
Hutchinson said the conversation was relayed to her by Tony Ornato, a senior Secret Service official who was Trump's deputy chief of staff for operations.
Ilya Somin, professor of law at George Mason University, said the testimony could ""bolster the chances of indicting and convicting Trump, especially insofar as some potential charges hinge on his motives and state of mind.""
Trump denied Hutchinson's account in a statement posted on Truth Social, his social media app, and called her story about him grabbing the steering wheel ""fake"" and ""fraudulent."" Trump has accused the committee of conducting a ""sham investigation.""

152,"Union says Amazon continues to interfere with election at Alabama warehouse
Feb 22 (Reuters) - A U.S. retail workers' union on Tuesday accused Amazon.com Inc of unlawfully interfering with a union election at an Alabama warehouse where the company had already been found to have engaged in unlawful conduct to deter labor organizing.
The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claiming Amazon removed union literature from employee break rooms, limited workers' access to the warehouse before and after shifts and forced workers to attend anti-union meetings.
Amazon in a statement provided by spokesperson Kelly Nantel said it was confident it had fully complied with the law.
""Our focus remains on working directly with our team to make Amazon a great place to work,"" the company said..
The NLRB sent unionization ballots to workers at the Bessemer, Alabama, plant earlier this month and will tally the votes at the end of March. read more
The RWDSU was handily defeated in an election held last year, but the NLRB threw out those results after finding that Amazon unlawfully influenced the vote by encouraging workers to place ballots in a mailbox on company property. read more
Amazon and a group of New York workers last week agreed tentatively on terms for a union election at a different warehouse, and an organizer said that vote would take place late next month. read more
The charges filed on Tuesday could lay the groundwork for the RWDSU to challenge the results of the pending election in Alabama if it loses.
The union said in the charges that meetings featuring anti-union messaging that Amazon workers are required to attend are coercive, and that workers should have the right to opt out of them.
So-called ""captive audience meetings"" are currently legal under U.S. labor law and are a common feature of employer campaigns to discourage unionizing.

154,"U.S. judge sentences wife of Mexican drug lord 'El Chapo' to three years in prison
WASHINGTON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge sentenced the wife of imprisoned Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman to three years in prison on Tuesday, after she pleaded guilty to helping the Sinaloa drug cartel.
Before her sentencing in a federal court in Washington, Emma Coronel Aispuro, 32, pleaded with U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras to show her mercy.
""With all due respect, I address you today to express my true regret for any and all harm that I may have done, and I ask that you and all the citizens of this country forgive me,"" she said in Spanish through an interpreter.
She added that she feared the judge might find it difficult to forgive her because she is Guzman's wife. ""Perhaps for this reason you feel there is a need for you to be harder on me, but I pray that you not do that,"" she added.
Coronel pleaded guilty in June to three counts of conspiring to distribute illegal drugs, conspiring to launder money and of engaging in financial dealings with the Sinaloa drug cartel.
Federal prosecutors on Tuesday askedthat a four-year prison term be imposed on Coronel, adding that she would be forfeiting $1.5 million as part of her sentence.
""While the overall effect of the defendant's conduct was significant, the defendant's actual role was a minimal one. The defendant acted primarily in support of her husband,"" federal prosecutor Anthony Nardozzi said.
He noted that after her arrest, she ""quickly accepted responsibility for her criminal conduct.""

LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - For all the angst caused by this year's 65% oil price leap, concerns about a return to 1970s-style stagflation are overblown and the developed world, at least, can probably handle even costlier crude without too much stress.
Alternative energy sources, a rise in less energy-intense service sectors, plus more efficient vehicles, gadgets and power plants mean that oil demand has evolved, not just from the 1970s but even since 2008 when oil futures neared $150.

168,"It’s time to worry about Greece again
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis addresses lawmakers during a parliamentary session on a wiretapping case, in Athens, Greece, August 26, 2022. REUTERS/Costas Baltas
ATHENS, Aug 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It is only a few years since the Grexit horror movie ended. But sadly Greece’s creditors, investors and allies need to start worrying about the country again. A bugging scandal threatens Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ government and prolonged political instability. This is not a re-run of the crisis that threatened to eject Greece from the euro. But the state’s high deficit and debt – which is 189% of GDP – are a cause for concern at a time of soaring energy prices and rising interest rates.
Earlier this month the leader of Pasok, one of Greece’s opposition parties, accused the country’s intelligence service of bugging his phone. There had also been an unsuccessful attempt from an unknown source to infect his phone with spyware, called Predator.
Mitsotakis, leader of the centre-right New Democracy party, said he was unaware of the phone tapping and wouldn’t have approved it if he had known read more . He fired the head of the intelligence service. The government’s general secretary, to whom the intelligence service reported and who is Mitsotakis’ nephew, also quit. The government denies purchasing or using Predator. Nevertheless, the Greek parliament has reconvened to debate the issue today.
POLITICAL INSTABILITY
Although Mitsotakis has a solid majority, he has to call an election at the latest by August 2023. This will be fought under proportional representation, with the result that no party will get an overall majority. There will then be a second election, under a new law, which will give the leading party a large number of bonus members of parliament.
Opinion polls previously suggested Mitsotakis would win a majority in this second election – or come close to doing so. But following the eruption of the bugging scandal, this no longer seems likely. What is more, it will be hard for him to form a coalition, as his obvious partner was Pasok, the centre-left party whose leader’s phone was tapped. It will be extremely reluctant to do a deal with Mitsotakis.
However, it will also be hard for Greece’s largest opposition party, the left-wing Syriza, to form a coalition. Though it would try to cut a deal with Pasok, the two groups probably wouldn’t have a majority. They might only be able to get one via a fanciful coalition including the communists and the far-right.
There are other possibilities. New Democracy might replace Mitsotakis with a leader more appealing to Pasok. Another is that Greek parties might form a grand coalition, led by a technocrat. But none of the scenarios looks terribly stable. Meanwhile, many questions about the bugging scandal remain unanswered. If there are further damaging revelations, Mitsotakis may struggle to hang on until the election.
HIGH EXPECTATIONS
Investors and Greece’s allies have been generally enthusiastic about Mitsotakis’ premiership. His pro-business approach and pledge to modernise the country attracted capital. His promise to run a sound fiscal policy reassured the European Union, which holds the lion’s share of the country’s humungous debt. He managed the pandemic well, drove forward the government’s digitalisation, and took steps to decarbonise the economy. And his firm line against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine got plaudits not just in other European capitals but also in Washington. He even delivered a speech to a joint session of U.S. Congress.
There are also concerns, though. Mitsotakis didn’t seem terribly interested in fighting corruption. He effectively wiped the slate clean for many financiers accused of criminal breach of trust and gave what amounted to an amnesty to large tax evaders. He also centralised power, changing the law so that the intelligence service reported to his office.
At the same time, fiscal policy was looser than might have been expected for a country that had recently gone through a near-death experience. The government handed out a lot of money to support firms and workers during the pandemic. It has also spent a larger proportion of GDP than any other EU country cushioning consumers and businesses from the energy crisis, according to Bruegel, the Brussels-based think tank. The government is on course to run a primary deficit (before interest payments) of about 3.5% of GDP this year, according to Miranda Xafa, a Greek economist.
POPULISM AHEAD
A new government seems likely to be less pro-business than the current one. There is also a risk that Mitsotakis will take populist measures – especially spending yet more money to cap energy bills - in an attempt to hang onto power. As one election follows another, other parties will have the incentive to promise more public spending.
Greece’s creditors might argue that this doesn’t matter too much. The country’s debt was restructured as part of its bailouts. It doesn’t have to repay the principal or interest on the debt it owes the EU until 2033. ",300,"What is more, although debt has been rising, the combination of inflation and economic growth means the burden has shrunk as a percentage of GDP: the ratio declined by 4 percentage points in the first quarter of the year.","What is more, although debt has been rising, the combination of inflation and economic growth means the burden has grown as a percentage of GDP: the ratio increased by 4 percentage points in the first quarter of the year.","What is more, although debt has been rising, the combination of inflation and economic growth means the burden has increased as a percentage of GDP: the ratio risen by 4 percentage points in the first quarter of the year.","What is more, although debt has been rising, the combination of inflation and economic growth means the burden has shrunk as a percentage of GDP: the ratio declined by 2 percentage points in the first quarter of the year.",43.0,"�s high deficit and debt – which is 189% of GDP – are a cause for concern at a time of soaring energy prices and rising interest rates.

At the same time, fiscal policy was looser than might have been expected for a country that had recently gone through a near-death experience. The government handed out a lot of money to support firms and workers during the pandemic. It has also spent a larger proportion of GDP than any other EU country cushioning consumers and businesses from the energy crisis, according to Bruegel, the Brussels-based think tank. The government is on course to run a primary deficit (before interest payments) of about 3.5% of GDP this year, according to Miranda Xafa, a Greek economist.
POPULISM AHEAD
A new government seems likely to be less pro-business than the current one. There is also a risk that Mitsotakis will take populist measures – especially spending yet more money to cap energy bills - in an attempt to hang onto power. As one election follows another, other parties will have the incentive to promise more public spending.
Greece’s creditors might argue that this doesn’t matter too much. The country’s debt was restructured as part of its bailouts. It doesn’t have to repay the principal or interest on the debt it owes the EU until 2033. "
169,"Explainer: Might Russia recognise 'independence' of breakaway east Ukraine regions?
MOSCOW, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A group of Russian lawmakers have urged parliament to appeal to President Vladimir Putin to recognise two pro-Russian breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent states.
Here's a look at what such a move might mean for the Ukraine crisis, in which Russia has deployed around 100,000 troops near its neighbour's border in preparation for what the United States says - and Moscow denies - could be an imminent invasion.
WHAT ARE THE BREAKAWAY REGIONS?
Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - collectively known as the Donbass - broke away from Ukrainian government control in 2014 and proclaimed themselves independent ""people's republics"", so far unrecognised. Since then, Ukraine says about 15,000 people have been killed in fighting. Russia denies being a party to the conflict but has backed the separatists in numerous ways, including through covert military support, financial aid, supplies of COVID-19 vaccine and the issue of more than 600,000 Russian passports to residents. A Ukrainian defence ministry source said Kyiv estimated there were 35,000 separatist fighters and 2,000 Russian regular forces in Donbass, though Russia disputes this. read more
IF RUSSIA RECOGNISES THEM, WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS?
Russian recognition would kill off the 2014 and 2015 Minsk peace agreements that, although still unimplemented, have until now been seen by Russia, Ukraine and Western governments as the best chance for a solution. The 2015 deal called for self-government for the two regions in accordance with Ukrainian law. read more
Recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk ""statehood"" could provide Moscow with a pretext for overt military intervention in support of its allies, in the same way that it has stationed troops in breakaway regions of Georgia (see below). A Russian parliament member and former Donetsk political leader, Alexander Borodai, told Reuters that, in this scenario, the separatists would look to Russia to help them wrest control of parts of Donbass now controlled by Ukrainian forces. Western governments have lined up to warn Moscow that any movement of military forces across the Ukrainian border would draw a strong response, including stringent financial sanctions. read more
HAS RUSSIA RECOGNISED BREAKAWAY STATELETS BEFORE?
Yes - it recognised the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two breakaway regions of Georgia, after fighting a short war with Georgia in 2008. It has provided them with extensive budget support, extended Russian citizenship to their populations and stationed thousands of troops there.
WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS FOR MOSCOW?
In the Georgia case, Russia used recognition of the breakaway regions to justify an open-ended military presence in a neighbouring former Soviet republic and indefinitely thwart Georgia's NATO aspirations by denying it full control of its own territory.
Olesya Vartanyan, a South Caucasus specialist at Crisis Group, said there was also a significant downside for Moscow, however, in taking responsibility for two territories unrecognised by even its close allies and with no prospects for economic development. ""You don't really know what to do with them but you still have to continue financing them, you have to provide funds and from time to time you have to deal with their internal crises,"" she said. Russia had also destroyed any possibility of dialogue on foreign policy with Georgia.

Qatar 2022 was the first World Cup to feature 48 teams vying for the ultimate football trophy.
CONMEBOL petitioned FIFA in April 2018 to expand the 2022 World Cup from 32 to 48 teams four years before the 2026 World Cup.
FIFA, however, denied the request just before the commencement of the 2018 World Cup, hinting that it will do so again in the future. This means that the World Cup will be the final one to feature only 32 countries next year.

HONG KONG, Jan 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Competitors don’t always care who wins, so long as they beat their fiercest rival. Two blank-cheque companies are due to price this week in Singapore’s first such listings read more . The city is besting arch-challenger Hong Kong, whose own regime launched two weeks back. Yet the New York boom that inspired both peaked almost a year ago and neither will match its success in hosting shell companies.
Last year New York hosted the initial public offerings of 612 special-purpose acquisition companies which raised $162 billion, per Dealogic data. Even after the market was shaken by increased regulatory scrutiny of SPAC accounting and companies’ breathlessly optimistic revenue forecasts, about $10 billion was being raised per month by the end of 2021.

175,"BEIJING, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Athletes considering staging political protests during the Beijing 2022 Winter Games will have to negotiate the International Olympic Committee’s Rule 50 which originally banned such behaviour but now offers more freedom.
They will also have to abide by the law in Communist Party-ruled China, which has rejected accusations in the West of rights abuses in Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and elsewhere and comes down hard on dissent.
“Any expression that is in line with the Olympic spirit I’m sure will be protected,” Yang Shu, deputy director general of Beijing 2022’s International Relations Department, told reporters last month.
“And anything and any behaviour or speeches that is against the Olympic spirit, especially against Chinese laws and regulations, are also subject to certain punishment.”
In principle, freedom of speech is protected by China’s constitution, but people are frequently punished for making comments the state deems undesirable, with authorities citing laws under the Penal Code on “disrupting public order” or “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” to censure speech.
Such legal enforcement is believed to be rarely applied to foreigners in China.
The IOC Rule 50 originally forbade athletes from any form of political protest at the Games. A revision prior to last year’s Tokyo Summer Olymp.
Any statement or protest on the field of play, however, requires the approval of a working group that includes among others the IOC and the international federation of the sport in question.
The revision was a direct result of pressure on the IOC from athletes before the Tokyo Games, where many took a knee to oppose racism, a protest popularised by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016.
There were several athletes who made political statements in Tokyo, including American shotputter Raven Saunders’ medals podium protest which went unpunished.
Saunders had raised her arms and crossed them into an X, saying later it represented “the intersection of where all people who are oppressed meet”.
PENG SHUAI CASE
But athletes making a political statement in Japan did not have to fear potential consequences by the host nation. Applying the same model in Beijing could have different consequences.
Some athletes have been critical of both China and the IOC for awarding the Games to Beijing, which also held the Summer Games in 2008.
“We are now standing here having to justify ourselves for the Olympic Games (being held) in a country where human rights are violated,” Germany’s triple Olympic medallist in biathlon Erik Lesser said last month.
“So in turn we have to be more critical about what Thomas Bach as president of the IOC did not achieve.”
Fears about freedom of speech have been raised by the case of former world doubles number one Peng Shuai, whose wellbeing became a matter of international concern in November when she alleged on social media that a former Chinese vice premier, Zhang Gaoli, had sexually assaulted her.

180,"Mario Draghi resigns, plunging Italy into political turmoil
- Summary
- Italy set to hold election in September
- PM Draghi resigns after key partners shun confidence vote
- President asks him to stay on as caretaker
- Markets fall heavily over political crisis
ROME, July 21 (Reuters) - Italy will hold a snap national election on Sept. 25 after Prime Minister Mario Draghi resigned following the collapse of his national unity government, sending tremors through financial markets.
It will be the first autumn national election for more than a century in Italy, where the second half of the year is normally taken up with getting the budget law through parliament.
It is likely to be a fractious campaign fought in the fierce summer heat in a drought-hit country.
A bloc of conservative parties, led by the far-right Brothers of Italy, looks likely to win a clear majority at the ballot, a study of opinion polls showed this week. read more
Draghi, an unelected former central banker who has led a broad coalition for almost 18 months, handed in his resignation earlier on Thursday and was asked by President Sergio Mattarella to stay on in a caretaker capacity.
""We must deal with the emergencies related to the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, inflation and the cost of energy,"" Draghi told cabinet colleagues.
He said that the government must also implement the National Recovery and Resilience Plan that sees Italy tapping billions of euros of post-pandemic European Union funds in return for reforms.
Although the vote is set for the end of September, it might take weeks of haggling before a new administration is sworn in.
Draghi's coalition crumbled on Wednesday when three of his main partners snubbed a confidence vote he had called to try to end divisions and renew their troubled alliance.

- Brentford end losing sequence
- Chances few and far between in dull draw
LONDON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Brentford ended their long losing run in the Premier League on the day new signing Christian Eriksen was introduced to the fans but a 0-0 draw at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday did little to soothe the club's relegation jitters.
A dreadfully dull game was crying out for the watching Dane's flair as defences ruled the day and the two teams cancelled each other out.
Brentford, who have dropped too close for comfort to the bottom three after five successive defeats from an admittedly tough run of fixtures, had marginally the better opportunities to break the deadlock.
Bryan Mbeumo went close in the first half but could not poke his shot past Palace keeper Vicente Guaita who also saved after the break from Pontus Jansson.
There was an anxious moment for Brentford in stoppage time when Wilfried Zaha went down in the penalty area but referee Simon Hooper saw nothing wrong.
Brentford had an earlier penalty claim turned away when Palace defender Marc Guehi appeared to handle under pressure from Christian Norgaard, but again Hooper was unimpressed.
The draw kept Brentford in 14th place with 24 points from 25 games, seven points clear of the relegation places.
Palace moved up a spot to 12th with 26 points.
""We needed to create more to get one goal -- that's maybe down to the quality on the day. There are a lot of positives to take from this game,"" Brentford manager Thomas Frank said.

Stocks across Latin America (.MILA00000PUS) rose 7.3% in January in dollar terms, their biggest monthly increase since May, and compare to a 5% drop in Asian stocks outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS), a 1.9% drop in the overall Emerging Market (EM) index (.MSCIEF) and a 5.3% decline in the developed markets index (.MIWO00000PUS).

188,"U.S. consumer confidence dips; more plan to buy big-ticket items
- Summary
- Consumer confidence index falls moderately in January
- Plans to buy homes, autos and major appliances increase
- House price growth slows on year-on-year basis in November
WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence ebbed slightly in January, with more consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles and other big- ticket items even as they grew less optimistic about business and labor market conditions in the short term.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday also showed consumers' inflation expectations moderating for a second straight month, though still high. Labor market views softened a bit, likely reflecting the disruptions on businesses caused by the winter wave of COVID-19, fueled by the Omicron variant.
""While consumer confidence dipped this month, consumers generally have faith in the strength of this recovery,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 113.8 this month from 115.2 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 111.8. Despite the first decline in four months, the index is well above pandemic lows.
The survey places more emphasis on the labor market, which is tightening amid worker shortages. The cutoff date for the survey was Jan. 19. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell moderately in mid-January.
The Conference Board survey's measure of current conditions rose, a sign that the economy entered 2022 on strong footing. Its gauge of expectations for growth in the short term eased in line with views that Omicron will slow economic growth this quarter.
The United States is reporting an average of 696,541 new coronavirus infections a day, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. Infections, however, appear to be subsiding in some regions, including the hardest-hit New York.
Against the backdrop of a stock market rout, some economists viewed the decline in short-term expectations as a warning sign.
Wall Street has come under intense selling pressure as investors fear aggressive interest rates increases by the Federal Reserve to tame inflation, as well as a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. stocks were lower, with the S&P 500 index flirting with a correction for the second time this year. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
""We don't remember consumer confidence remaining high for long historically when Wall Street is in a tailspin, said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Consumers already think business conditions will not be as positive six months from now before the stock market tumbled.""
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS EASE
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, fell to a still-high reading of 43.8 this month from 44.2 in December.
This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department. There were 10.6 million jobs openings at the end of November. The unemployment rate is at a 22-month low of 3.9%.
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months slipped to 6.8% from 6.9% last month. The retreat in inflation expectations from a 13-year high of 7.3% last November is likely to be welcomed by Fed officials who started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to start raising rates in March.
Despite high inflation, more consumer expected to buy homes, cars and other big-ticket items over the next six months.
The share of consumers planning to buy a motor vehicle was the largest in six months. Buying intentions for household appliances like television sets and refrigerators also rose, but plans to purchase washing machines and clothes dryers fell.
Consumers were more keen to buy a house over the next six months, with the share the largest in the current series. There was a break in the series in November 2010.
With housing supply continuing to lag demand, that suggests home prices will likely remain elevated this year.

The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 113.8 this month from 115.2 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 111.8. Despite the first decline in four months, the index is well above pandemic lows.
The survey places more emphasis on the labor market, which is tightening amid worker shortages. The cutoff date for the survey was Jan. 19. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell moderately in mid-January.
The Conference Board survey's measure of current conditions rose, a sign that the economy entered 2022 on strong footing. Its gauge of expectations for growth in the short term eased in line with views that Omicron will slow economic growth this quarter.
The United States is reporting an average of 696,541 new coronavirus infections a day, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. Infections, however, appear to be subsiding in some regions, including the hardest-hit New York.
Against the backdrop of a stock market rout, some economists viewed the decline in short-term expectations as a warning sign.
Wall Street has come under intense selling pressure as investors fear aggressive interest rates increases by the Federal Reserve to tame inflation, as well as a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. stocks were lower, with the S&P 500 index flirting with a correction for the second time this year. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
""We don't remember consumer confidence remaining high for long historically when Wall Street is in a tailspin, said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Consumers already think business conditions will not be as positive six months from now before the stock market tumbled.""
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS EASE
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, fell to a still-high reading of 43.8 this month from 44.2 in December.
This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department. There were 10.6 million jobs openings at the end of November. The unemployment rate is at a 22-month low of 3.9%.
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months slipped to 6.8% from 6.9% last month. The retreat in inflation expectations from a 13-year high of 7.3% last November is likely to be welcomed by Fed officials who started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to start raising rates in March.
Despite high inflation, more consumer expected to buy homes, cars and other big-ticket items over the next six months.
The share of consumers planning to buy a motor vehicle was the largest in six months. Buying intentions for household appliances like television sets and refrigerators also rose, but plans to purchase washing machines and clothes dryers fell.
Consumers were more keen to buy a house over the next six months, with the share the largest in the current series. There was a break in the series in November 2010.
With housing supply continuing to lag demand, that suggests home prices will likely remain elevated this year. "

- Wall Street rises, European stocks closed higher
NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks rallied on Thursday, while Treasury yields fell for the third straight day as investors digested data showing a declining U.S. economy for a second straight quarter, a day after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates.
The dollar dropped to a six-week low against the yen, tracking the decline in Treasury yields, after the economic data, which fueled speculation that the Fed will not raise rates as aggressively going forward. read more

The data followed a Fed commitment on Wednesday to not flinch in its battle against the most intense U.S. inflation since the 1980s, even if that means a ""sustained period"" of economic weakness and a slowing jobs market. read more
U.S. equities had also rallied on Wednesday as Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments prompted bets that rate hikes would begin to slow and lead to rate cuts in 2023.
The decline in treasury yields on Thursday implied bets for a more gradual pace of tightening going forward, according to Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones who also noted that GDP declined at a time when the Fed had not raised rates that much.
""It's certainly going to be an interesting balance between hopefully inflation moderating but then consumers having to face a more challenging economic backdrop,"" Mahajan said. ""We don't see the scope for a deep and prolonged recession but the slowdown the market is pricing in is likely to come to fruition in the next couple of quarters, maybe even into the first quarter of 2023.""
While the S&P has ""done a lot of the work to the downside to price in a moderate recessionary environment,"" Mahajan sees more volatility ahead as ""the fundamentals play a little bit of catch up.""

SHANGHAI, Nov 8 (Reuters) - (This November 8 story corrected to say Tencent earnings will be published on Nov. 10, not Nov. 11)
China's biggest listed companies Tencent (0700.HK) and Alibaba (9988.HK) are expected to report a fall in profits and slowing revenue growth in the July-September quarter, hurt by the year-long regulatory crackdown that has upended its tech industry.
Beijing has reasserted control over its once-freewheeling internet sector, punishing well-known names for engaging in what were previously considered regular market practices and drafting new rules to change how they compete and engage users.
""We believe the financial impact of regulatory headwinds in China will be reflected in (third quarter) earnings and (fourth quarter) guidance,"" KGI Asia analysts said in a note last month.
Tencent Holdings Ltd - the country's largest firm by market value and its first big tech name to report earnings on Wednesday - is expected to post a 12% fall in quarterly profit, its first drop in two years, according to Refinitiv data.
The gaming giant's revenue is expected to rise 16.4%, the slowest pace since the first quarter of 2019, after the government imposed new limits on the amount of time minors can spend playing video games. China's gaming regulator also has not approved any new games since August.

197,"Exclusive: Britain preparing for end-June switch to paid COVID tests - document
- Summary
- New target for ending universal offer is end-June
- Earlier target moved by Omicron
- Readying for some public disappointment -document
LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - British health officials are aiming to be ready to start charging Britons for COVID-19 tests that are currently free at the end of June, a document seen by Reuters shows, in what could be a risky gambit for the government.
Britain has been increasingly dependent on rapid testing to try to tackle the more-transmissible Omicron variant, which has spread rapidly through the population but is less severe.
The government has previously said it will end the universal free provision of easy-to-use lateral flow devices (LFDs) at a ""later stage"", with individuals and businesses bearing the cost.
The Department of Health has declined to say what the tests cost, citing commercial contracts. One source has said they can run to 30 pounds ($40.75) for a pack of seven.
The tests have freely available to order online or pick up from local pharmacies since April. The UK Health Security Agency said that between Dec. 30 and Jan. 5 more than 8 million LFDs were conducted, the highest weekly figure on record.
The document seen by Reuters, which was shared between health agencies to prepare scenarios for the change, shows that the timetable for the switch has been pushed back from earlier in the year because of the arrival of the Omicron variant.
That target could move again if the virus throws what one official close to the health service described as a ""curve ball"", perhaps in the form of another variant, which would mean the plans would again be postponed.
Tackling the ongoing pandemic remains high on the political agenda in Britain, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under fire for attending an event in the garden of his Downing Street residence during a COVID-19 lockdown.
He has apologised for attending, but an increasing number of reports of alcohol-fuelled gatherings at the heart of government have prompted calls for his resignation, including from some in his governing Conservative Party. read more
The document says officials are now working on the premise that an online ordering system should be ready at the end of June to direct most people, excluding key workers and some others, to providers of paid-for LFDs in what is described as a ""ramp down of the Universal Testing Offer"".

- Summary
- New target for ending universal offer is end-June
- Earlier target moved by Omicron
- Readying for some public disappointment -document
LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - British health officials are aiming to be ready to start charging Britons for COVID-19 tests that are currently free at the end of June, a document seen by Reuters shows, in what could be a risky gambit for the government.
Britain has been increasingly dependent on rapid testing to try to tackle the more-transmissible Omicron variant, which has spread rapidly through the population but is less severe.
The government has previously said it will end the universal free provision of easy-to-use lateral flow devices (LFDs) at a ""later stage"", with individuals and businesses bearing the cost.
The Department of Health has declined to say what the tests cost, citing commercial contracts. One source has said they can run to 30 pounds ($40.75) for a pack of seven.
The tests have freely available to order online or pick up from local pharmacies since April. The UK Health Security Agency said that between Dec. 30 and Jan. 5 more than 8 million LFDs were conducted, the highest weekly figure on record.
The document seen by Reuters, which was shared between health agencies to prepare scenarios for the change, shows that the timetable for the switch has been pushed back from earlier in the year because of the arrival of the Omicron variant.
That target could move again if the virus throws what one official close to the health service described as a ""curve ball"", perhaps in the form of another variant, which would mean the plans would again be postponed.
Tackling the ongoing pandemic remains high on the political agenda in Britain, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under fire for attending an event in the garden of his Downing Street residence during a COVID-19 lockdown.
He has apologised for attending, but an increasing number of reports of alcohol-fuelled gatherings at the heart of government have prompted calls for his resignation, including from some in his governing Conservative Party. read more
The document says officials are now working on the premise that an online ordering system should be ready at the end of June to direct most people, excluding key workers and some others, to providers of paid-for LFDs in what is described as a ""ramp down of the Universal Testing Offer"".

- Summary

- Bosch, VW to build Level 2 and 3 software for VW fleet
- First functions to be deployed from 2023
- Bosch can later take software to outside market
BERLIN, Jan 25(Reuters) - Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) software subsidiary Cariad and autos supplier Bosch are teaming up to develop software for automated driving to use in Volkswagen's cars, the companies said in a joint statement on Tuesday.
Using data from Volkswagen's fleet, the partners will develop so-called Level 2 autonomous driving software - enabling hands-free driving in cities, rural areas and on the motorway - as well as a Level 3 system that takes over all driving functions on the motorway.
They expect to implement Level 2 software in Volkswagen vehicles from 2023.
After an undefined lead time, Bosch will take the technology to the outside market, its software chief Matthias Pillin said on a press call.
""Partnerships in software development are not unusual... once you have generated the relevant IP you can pursue your own paths,"" Cariad CEO Dirk Hilgenberg said.
The partnership is the second announced this year by the companies, which last week said they would set up a joint venture to equip battery cell factories with machinery. read more
They did not disclose how much they would invest in either deal.

199,"* Dollar eases off more than one-year high
* Banks prepare to scrap LME gold and silver contracts
* Fed lays out plan for tapering bond-buying program (Adds Fed minutes, updates prices)
Oct 13 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose 2% to a near one-month peak on Wednesday, as a pullback in the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields lifted demand for the safe-haven metal.
Spot gold was up 1.8% at $1,791.41 per ounce by 2:13 p.m. ET (1813 GMT).
U.S. gold futures settled 2% higher at $1,794.70.
Other precious metals also rose, with spot silver rising 2.5% to $23.09 per ounce, platinum gaining 1.2% to $1,019.54 and palladium adding 3.5% to $2,116.68.
“Gold is just following yields at the moment. The initial reaction after CPI (consumer price index) data was a big spike in yields, which is now starting to fade away,” said Daniel Pavilonis, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.
Gold initially pared gains as benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose above 1.6% following data showing U.S. consumer prices increased solidly in September and were poised for a further rise in coming months.
But a subsequent pullback in yields, which reduced the opportunity cost of holding non-interest bearing gold, drove a strong rally in precious metals.
The metal also drew support from a slide in the dollar and worries that high inflation would hit global economic growth.
“Inflation expectations mixed with global growth concerns have made many investors nervous that the business and the consumer will be much weaker in the second half of 2022. Safe-haven flows are starting to come gold’s way,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said in a note.
U.S. central bankers signaled they could start reducing their crisis-era support for the economy in mid-November, though they remain divided over how much of a threat high inflation poses and how soon they may need to raise interest rates in response, minutes from their Sept. 21-22 policy meeting showed.

200,"Brazil in recession as drought, inflation and interest rates bite
BRASILIA, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Brazil's economy contracted slightly in the three months to September, government data showed on Thursday, as surging inflation, steep interest rate hikes and a severe drought triggered a recession in Latin America's largest economy.
The 0.1% decline in Brazil's gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter, reported by official statistics agency IBGE, was below a median forecast for zero growth in a Reuters poll.
Brazil's economic rebound from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic has sputtered as inflation surged into double digits, forcing the central bank to raise borrowing costs aggressively despite the downturn.
Economists have said that the stubbornly high levels of inflation in Brazil have steadily eroded consumers' purchasing power, proving a drag on the economy.
Some analysts said Thursday's weak data may discourage the bank's monetary policy committee, called Copom, from an even larger interest rate increase at its December meeting.
""Against this backdrop, we no longer see Copom upping the pace of monetary tightening next week,"" William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, told clients in a note, forecasting another rate increase of 150 basis points.
Big rate hikes from the central bank, whose autonomy was written into Brazil's constitution this year, are one more headwind for a weak economy, which is weighing.
Agricultural production fell 8.0% in the third quarter, while industrial output was flat and services advanced 1.1%.
Brazil's auto industry has struggled to ramp up production amid a shortage of components such as microchips in global supply chains. Shortages have also hurt manufacturing in Mexico, whose economy contracted more than expected in the quarter. read more

BEIJING, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Beijing Olympics organisers are keeping up with the tradition of making condoms available to athletes, despite detailed social distancing guidelines intended to curb the spread of COVID-19 within the ""closed loop"" in which the Games will take place.
""All Olympic-related units will provide appropriate quantities of condoms for free at the appropriate time to people who've checked in to stay inside the loop,"" organisers told Reuters by email on Tuesday.

210,"Hosts England going for Euro glory but tournament remains wide open

LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - All eyes will be on whether England women can finally end their major trophy drought as they go into their home European Championship next week as one of the favourites, led by 2017 winning coach Sarina Wiegman.
The tournament, postponed last year due to COVID-19, is expected to be one of the most open in history with established nations such as Sweden and Germany contending with rising powerhouses like Spain and holders the Netherlands.
Wiegman led the Dutch to their first ever title five years ago and took charge of England last September looking to achieve the same feat for a team who have twice finished runners-up in the Euros (1984, 2009) but never won.
The 52-year-old has already worked her magic on a side who reached the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2019 and have not yet tasted defeat in 13 games under the Dutchwoman.
The Lionesses' squad is stacked with talent, bearing the fruits of England's top tier Women's Super League having turned fully professional in 2018.
Attendances at club games have greatly increased in recent years and the tournament opener, Group A's England v Austria at Old Trafford on July 6, is already a sell-out and is expected to be the first of many spectator records broken over the next month.
Sweden captain Magda Eriksson, who plays for domestic champions Chelsea, tipped the hosts to be her country's main rival to lift the trophy at Wembley.
""If I don't have to say Sweden, I would say that England have a really good team, an exciting team with a lot of talent,"" Eriksson told Reuters.
However, the Swedes, ranked second in the world, have experience of going the distance having won the inaugural edition in 1984, before it was organised by European soccer's governing body UEFA.
Their squad benefits from a wide array of experience with players plying their trade all over the continent, from veteran goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl at Atletico Madrid to 23-year-old Juventus defender Amanda Nilden who had a breakout season winning Serie A and reaching the Champions League quarter-finals.
However, when it comes to a winning pedigree in the Euros there is one side that cannot be matched - record eight-time winners Germany.
Martina Voss-Tecklenburg's team have been going through an underwhelming period of late, which included a shock 3-2 defeat to Serbia in 2023 World Cup qualifying in April. They will also be without influential midfielder Dzsenifer Marozsan who suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in May.
Nevertheless, it would be foolish to write off the Germans, who won six consecutive titles from 1995 to 2013.
AWARD-WINNING TALENT
They will be in Group B alongside Spain who will fancy their chances too, despite having only once gone beyond the quarter-finals.
Since the previous tournament, women's football in the country has gone from strength to strength with club side Barcelona becoming a superpower, winning the Champions League in 2021.
Spain are captained by Barca forward Alexia Putellas who was awarded the Ballon d'Or last year.
The first woman to win that award, Norway's Ada Hegerberg in 2018, makes her long-awaited return to international football having not represented the national team for five years between 2017 and April this year due to a dispute with the country's football association.
Norway fans can now relish the prospect of the striker being unleashed on their rivals, coming off the back of winning club side Olympique Lyonnais' record eighth Champions League title last month.
She holds the all-time record for the most goals in that competition with 59. She is only 26-years-old.
""There is no doubt that Ada's importance on the pitch is great. She is one of the world's best forwards and of course contributes a lot of quality to the team,"" Norway coach Martin Sjogren told Reuters. ""I am very happy to have Ada back in the national team.""
France would usually be among the favourites but there have been signs that all might not be well in Corinne Diacre's camp. The team underwhelmed at their home World Cup in 2019, losing in the quarter-finals to eventual champions the United States.
Diacre has also surprisingly chosen to travel to England without influential senior players Amandine Henry and Eugenie Le Sommer, their all-time leading goalscorer (86 goals), in her squad of 23.

211,"Argentina jails ex-military officers for crimes during dictatorship
BUENOS AIRES, July 6 (Reuters) - An Argentine judge sentenced 19 former military officers to prison on Wednesday for crimes against humanity committed during the country's brutal military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s, including for kidnappings of auto plant workers.
The latest trials in Argentina follow last week's Colombian truth commission report, following that South American country's decades-long bloody internal conflict, as pent up demands for justice yield some gains read more .
The sentences handed down by the federal court in the capital Buenos Aires include convictions for forced disappearances, homicides, torture, as well as the abduction of children, crimes committed against some 350 victims during the military regime that ruled the country between 1976 and 1983.
The dictatorship left as many as 30,000 disappeared persons, according to human rights groups, although determining precise figures remains a topic of debate.
Former General Santiago Riveros, previously convicted in other trials for human rights violations, was among those sentenced. He was ordered to serve a life term behind bars after being found guilty of more than a hundred crimes, including kidnapping, rape and murder, according to Wednesday's verdict.
Convictions handed down also covered charges that seven workers were kidnapped at a Mercedes Benz plant in the Buenos Aires suburbs beginning in 1976 by military forces with the backing of company executives.
According to the charges, executives complained to military authorities that the kidnapped employees either belonged to unions or sought to organize workers.
The abducted workers were taken to the infamous Campo de Mayo military compound, a secret facility that functioned like a concentration camp, and six of them officially remain missing though all are presumed dead.

220,"King Dollar stands tall as recession fears churn global markets
NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - A cocktail of global growth fears, Federal Reserve hawkishness and euro weakness has boosted the U.S. dollar to its highest level in around 20 years, and some investors are betting there may be more gains ahead.
The dollar index , which measures the greenback against six major currencies, is up 12% against a basket of its peers in 2022 and is on track for its best year since 2014. The measure has logged a gain 7 out of the last 10 years.
Multiple factors are driving the dollar’s gains. Investors believe the Federal Reserve is likely to continue raising interest rates more aggressively than many other global central banks as it faces the worst U.S. inflation in decades, making the dollar more attractive to yield-seeking investors. read more

221,"Lacking vaccines, North Korea battles COVID with antibiotics, home remedies
SEOUL, May 16 (Reuters) - Standing tall in bright red hazmat suits, five North Korean health workers stride towards an ambulance to do battle with a COVID-19 outbreak that - in the presumed absence of vaccines - the country is using antibiotics and home remedies to treat.
The isolated state is one of only two countries yet to begin a vaccination campaign and, until last week, had insisted it was COVID-free.
Now it is mobilizing forces including the army and a public information campaign to combat what authorities have acknowledged is an ""explosive"" outbreak.
In an interview on state television on Monday, Vice Minister of Public Health Kim Hyong Hun said the country had switched from a quarantine to a treatment system to handle the hundreds of thousands of suspected ""fever"" cases reported each day.
The broadcaster showed footage of the hazmat team, and masked workers opening windows, cleaning desks and machines and spraying disinfectant.
To treat COVID and its symptoms, state media have encouraged patients to use painkillers and fever reducers such as ibuprofen, and amoxicillin and other antibiotics - which do not fight viruses but are sometimes prescribed for secondary bacterial infections.
While previously playing down vaccines as ""no panacea"", media have also recommended gargling salt water, or drinking lonicera japonica tea or willow leaf tea three times a day.

KCNA said the cumulative tally of the fever-stricken stood at 1,213,550, with 50 deaths. It did not say how many suspected infections had tested positive for COVID.
Authorities say a large proportion of the deaths have been due to people ""careless in taking drugs due to the lack of knowledge and understanding"" of the Omicron variant and the correct method for treating it.
The World Health Organization has shipped some health kits and other supplies to North Korea, but has not said what drugs they contain. Neighbours China and South Korea have offered to send aid if Pyongyang requests it.

Despite a high number of trained doctors and experience mobilizing for health emergencies, North Korea's medical system is woefully under-resourced, experts say.

224,"WhatsApp wins approval to expand Indian payments service to 100 mln users -sources
NEW DELHI, April 12 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) WhatsApp has won regulatory approval to more than double the number of users of its payments service in India to 100 million, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
WhatsApp has over the years told National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) that there should be no cap on users of its payments service in India, its biggest market.
Instead, the NPCI told the company on Wednesday it can increase the number of users to 100 million from 40 million currently, the sources said.
WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The NPCI confirmed the development in a statement to Reuters.
Though the relaxation will come as a relief, the new cap could still limit WhatsApp's growth prospects given it has more than 500 million users in India.
WhatsApp has told the NPCI several times it wants to operate ""without a cap"", but privately the NPCI is of the view that allowing all its users to access the payments service - integrated with the app and allowing contacts to send each other funds - could strain the country's financial infrastructure, said one of the sources.
The NPCI gave WhatsApp approval to launch the payments service in 2020 after the company spent years trying to comply with Indian regulations, including data storage norms that require all payments-related data to be stored locally.
It started with 20 million users and the cap was increased to 40 million in November last year. read more

240,"* U.S., some European state oppose Russian-backed pipeline
* Surging gas prices push Europe to find more supplies
* Russian lawmaker says delays not in interest of EU (Adds lawyer, updates prices)
FRANKFURT, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Germany’s energy regulator has suspended the approval process for a major new pipeline bringing Russian gas into Europe, throwing up a new roadblock to the contentious project and driving up regional gas prices.
The watchdog said on Tuesday it had temporarily halted the certification process here because the Swiss-based consortium behind Nord Stream 2 first needed to form a German subsidiary company under German law to secure an operating licence.
European prices jumped almost 11% on news of the hold-up, with the Dutch front-month contract hitting 90.40 euros/MWh in afternoon trade.
“This does push back expected timelines quite a bit,” said analyst Trevor Sikorski at Energy Aspects, adding that it was unclear how long the process of establishing a new company and reapplying for certification would take.
First flows through the pipeline look very unlikely in the first half of 2022, he added.
Nord Stream 2 has faced stiff opposition from the United States and some European states, which say it will make Europe too reliant on Russian gas. But other European governments say the link is vital to secure energy supplies, with gas prices surging in recent weeks and the threat of power outages here looming this winter.
Nord Stream 2 said it had been notified by the regulator about the certification decision. “We are not in a position to comment on the details of the procedure, its possible duration and impacts on the timing of the start of the pipeline operations,” it added.
The Kremlin was not immediately available to comment.
“Any delays in the pipeline certification, all the more so on the eve of winter, is not in the interests of the European Union, that’s without any doubt,” Konstantin Kosachyov, deputy chairman of Russian parliament’s upper house, told TASS news agency.
The regulator, the Bundesnetzagentur, said it would only assess an application after a transfer of major assets and budgets for staffing to a German subsidiary.
“A certification for the operation of Nord Stream 2 will only be considered once the operator is organised in a legal shape compliant with German law,” it said.
Once these preconditions had been met, it said it could continue assessing the submission in the rest of the four-month application period. Before the suspension, that period was meant to run until early January.
Lawyers said the move, viewed by some gas market traders as politically charged, made sense from a regulatory perspective because it meant the pipeline’s operators in Germany would be answerable to local rules.
Essen-based law firm Rosin Buedenbender said a number of limited liability company options were available.
UKRAINIAN OPPOSITION
Ukraine is one country bitterly opposed to the pipeline, which has fed into broader tensions between Kyiv and Moscow at a time when the United States has accused Russia of building up troops near Ukraine in preparation for a possible attack, an allegation the Kremlin has dismissed.
Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014 and Moscow-backed separatists took control of the Donbass region in eastern Ukraine that same year.
The head of the Ukrainian energy firm Naftogaz told Reuters that he welcomed the German energy regulator’s decision.
“Good,” Yuriy Vitrenko said. “This is an important point, which suggests that the German regulator shares our position that certification cannot only apply to the pipeline in Germany, but should apply to the entire pipeline from the territory of the Russian Federation to the territory of Germany.”
Kyiv will lose revenues if gas from Russia bypasses it and it accuses Moscow of using energy as a weapon to threaten Europe’s security.
Moscow has denied this and says Nord Stream 2 is a purely commercial venture that complies with European energy rules.
Ukraine has successfully applied to be part of the consultation process to certify the pipeline.

HONG KONG, June 1 (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) plans to invest more than 3 billion yuan($448 million) in its Chinese operations, Chief Executive Noel Quinn told state news agency Xinhua, saying he sees challenges for the economy but also opportunities for investments.
The investment roadmap comes just a month after HSBC's largest investor, Chinese insurance firm Ping An (601318.SS), called on the bank to look at ways to boost returns, which included a proposal to separate its Asia operations, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. read more
London-headquartered HSBC, Europe's biggest lender by total assets, earned just over half of its revenue and about two-thirds of its reported pretax profit in 2021 from Asia.
In the rare interview with Xinhua, Quinn said the Chinese investment would be carried out over a five-year period running until 2025 without specifying the divisions that would receive the cash.
An HSBC spokesperson confirmed the interview with Xinhua.
HSBC is one of the largest investors among foreign banks in mainland China and employs around 7,000 staff in the country. It has a branch network of more than 150 outlets across 50 cities.
While noting that COVID-19 cases in Shanghai had started to fall after a two-month lockdown, Quinn said the challenges confronting the Chinese economy should not be ""understated"".

247,"Deliveroo found guilty of abusing riders' rights in France
PARIS, April 19 (Reuters) - Two former managers of Deliveroo (ROO.L) were given suspended one-year prison sentences and fined 30,000 euros ($32,380) by a French court on Tuesday for abusing the freelance status of cycle riders working for the British takeaway delivery platform.
The company was also fined the maximum penalty of 375,000 euros and will have to publish the court decision on Deliveroo's French home page for one month.
Deliveroo said it would appeal the decision.
The ruling may reverberate outside France as the gig economy, built largely upon digital apps and self-employed workers, faces a number of court challenges that may redefine working conditions.
Under French law, employee status grants rights, including unemployment benefits, social security and pension contributions.
The administrative investigation, which reviewed a period extending from 2015 to 2017, and the subsequent court hearings showed that Deliveroo had imposed an almost permanent surveillance and control over riders' work while they were connected, judge Sylvie Daunis said.

- Summary
- The past year has seen in uptick in law deans tapped for college or university presidencies
- Law deans at Boston College, Cornell, UC Irvine and, most recently, SMU have left to run other schools
- Experts say running a law school and a college require similar skills
(Reuters) - Law deans are in demand when it comes to filling vacant college and university presidencies.
Memphis’ Rhodes College on Monday named Southern Methodist University law dean Jennifer Collins as its next president, making her at least the fifth legal educator to follow that path in the past year. A typical year will see one or two law deans make the move.
“There has been more than normal this year,” said Jim Rosenblatt, dean emeritus of Mississippi College School of Law, who tracks law dean moves. “Their discipline, background and experience makes them logical candidates to go on to a higher university position.”
Longtime Boston College law dean Vincent Rougeau become president of the College of Holy Cross in July. Eduardo Peñalver assumed the presidency of Seattle University this summer after serving as dean of Cornell Law School since 2014. Former University of California, Irvine School of Law dean Song Richardson is in her sixth month as president of Colorado College, a small liberal arts school in Colorado Springs. And former Mercer University law dean Cathy Cox in October become president of Georgia College and State University.
Running a law school and a university require some overlapping skills, said William Howard, a consultant with recruiting firm Academic Search.
Both roles handle fundraising and manage student, faculty and alumni relations, he said — though overseeing a sports program is a new responsibility for law deans who move into the president’s office. Law deans' analytical skills and familiarity with regulatory matters also make them attractive, Howard added.
“Being the CEO of a small school that’s fairly independent, has their own alumni base, does fundraising, and has serious accreditation oversight — you sort of get most aspects of a presidency,” he said.
Rhodes College highlighted Collins’ fundraising track record in the announcement of her appointment, saying she had raised $50 million during her tenure as law dean. Officials there also touted her experience managing an annual $49 million budget.

- Pilots agree to 25% wage cut
- Deal allows SAS to finalise bankruptcy protection process

COPENHAGEN/STOCKHOLM, July 19 (Reuters) - SAS (SAS.ST) and pilot unions have reached a wage deal, the Scandinavian airline confirmed on Tuesday, ending a 15-day strike over a new collective bargaining agreement that had grounded 3,700 flights and put the carrier's future in doubt.

The deal will allow the airline to finalise plans in the next few weeks to raise $700 million of fresh financing needed to see it through the bankruptcy protection process, it said.

Bank of America (BAC.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) collectively took about $1.5 billion of writedowns in the second quarter on loans they made to highly indebted companies.

FRANKFURT, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Germany's federal network agency on Wednesday curbed the permitted return on new infrastructure for power and gas networks in the years to 2029 to protect consumers from higher energy bills.
The move, which the authority said was led by the general interest rate environment, comes as a surge in energy prices has left households facing an expensive winter heating season. read more

258,"The company’s shares plunged 20 percent on Thursday after announcing a production halt. While Peloton’s revenue growth has been slowing, it has seen its highest sales growth in more than a year. As a result, the company has decided to adjust its hiring plans to reduce costs. It will also overhaul its product development teams and showrooms. However, this decision is unlikely to benefit shareholders.
The news that Peloton is considering a production halt has caused shares to fall more than 12%. This has been the case for a few months. In November, the company reported that it was reducing its full-year guidance by $1 billion. Analysts have cited the company’s recent announcement of the closure of a US manufacturing plant. It is not clear whether the company needs the additional capacity at this point. On top of that, the company has hired McKinsey consultants to review its cost structure, which could result in store closures and job cuts.
The news is not a positive for the company, but it does signal the importance of its future prospects. Peloton has already increased its manufacturing capacity and will continue to lower its prices. While this could create a competitive disadvantage for competitors, the company is still generating significant revenue from subscriptions and ad-based sales. As a result, investors should find Peloton’s lower valuation attractive. Its shares started the year at a price-to-sales ratio of about twenty and are now trading at 5.6 times its forward revenue guidance.
While it is difficult to predict a recession, there are some bright spots for the fitness-minded company. The company’s IPO price of $29 has been hit by heightened competition and price sensitivity. The company announced a $420 million acquisition of Precor last month, adding a half-million square feet of production space in North Carolina. Meanwhile, subscribers are using their bikes less frequently. In the third quarter, the average monthly workout dropped from 26 to 16 according to a report released by Peloton.

259,"Australia's central bank ends bond buying, but in no hurry to hike
- Summary
- RBA keeps rates at 0.1%, ends bond buying as expected
- Not a sign of a 'near-term' rate increase, still patient
- Inflation forecast raised, jobless lowered but wages lag
SYDNEY, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank kept its cash rate at a record low of 0.1% on Tuesday and ended its A$275 billion ($194.40 billion) bond buying campaign as expected, but pushed back hard on market wagers for an early rate rise.
Wrapping up its February policy meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) emphasised that ceasing bond purchases did ""not imply"" a near-term increase in interest rates and the Board was still prepared to be patient.
""As the Board has stated previously, it will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3% target range,"" RBA Governor Philip Lowe said in a brief statement. ""While inflation has picked up, it is too early to conclude that it is sustainably within the target band.""
The dovish message saw the local dollar slip a touch to $0.7055 , though markets still think the RBA is behind the curve on inflation. Lowe is now set to give a speech on policy on Wednesday and the bank will release a full set of economic forecasts on Friday.
Most analysts had expected an end to bond buying as such quantitative easing was no longer required with unemployment falling to 13-year lows of 4.2% and core inflation surging to seven-year highs of 2.6%.
The latter was a major shock given the RBA had thought core inflation would not reach 2.5% until the end of next year.
As a result, Lowe said core inflation was now forecast to rise to around 3.25% in coming quarters, before easing to 2.75% over 2023. Unemployment was seen falling to below 4% later this year and to be around 3.75% at the end of next year.
Markets have long been wagering the RBA will ultimately blink on inflation and raise rates as early as May, with another four hikes to 1.25% priced in by December.
A May move would also be a political hot potato given a national election is likely to be called for that month. read more

262,"Japan's Q3 growth forecast trimmed further on COVID-19 drag
TOKYO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely grew at a slower pace than previously expected last quarter and faces ongoing risks from soaring raw material prices and coronavirus-linked production and supply disruptions, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Friday.
Government and central bank policymakers are hoping a jump in consumer activity put the export-reliant economy firmly on a recovery path after Japan saw COVID-19 case numbers plummet and made progress on vaccinations.
Analysts, however, warned of risks such as an unexpected economic slowdown in China and semiconductor chip and factory parts shortages due to the pandemic.
""There is a risk problems due to supply chain disruption will last longer, putting downward pressure on the global economy,"" said Harumi Taguchi, principal economist at IHS Markit.
Japan's economy grew an annualised 0.8% in the third quarter, weaker than a 1.2% expansion projected last month, according to the median forecast of 39 analysts polled.
Growth is expected to accelerate to 4.5% this quarter as an end to state of emergency curbs boosts consumption and corporate activity, the poll showed.
The projection was roughly in line with last month's forecast for 4.4% growth, the Oct. 6-14 poll showed.
Parts shortages and factory disruptions in Southeast Asia have forced Japanese automakers to cut output in recent months, clouding the outlook for the export-reliant economy.
Japanese companies also face rising raw material costs, aggravated by a weaker yen, that could erode margins.
For a major importer of raw materials like Japan, rising input costs will worsen terms of trade, said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.
""That will lead to a decrease in corporate profits and real purchasing power for consumers,"" Iwashita said.
The poll also showed Japan's new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida should focus on fighting the coronavirus pandemic, boosting digitalisation of the economy and stimulating domestic demand and consumption.

Tragically, it wasn’t.
Travis accepted it, with his life partner
“I needed to get something up above in my wardrobe, and when I ventured down, I stepped on the ring. I was insanely crying in my wardrobe for quite a long time, and afterward I called Travis. I was as, ‘I accomplished something ridiculously awful.'”

266,"Citgo Petroleum lost $160 million in 2021 from impact of storm
HOUSTON, March 31 (Reuters) - (This March 31 story fixes typographical error in first paragraph)
U.S. oil refiner Citgo Petroleum on Thursday reported its second consecutive annual loss, of $160 million for 2021, as earnings were hit by a winter storm early in the year.
Results at the U.S. arm of Venezuela's state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), have slid as the United States in 2019 cut its access to Venezuelan crude, and results more recently were hit by higher costs and the temporary closure of its Corpus Christi, Texas, refinery.
Its fourth quarter showed a net income of $21 million on higher crude processing and refinery utilization, the company said. Crude utilization in the quarter rose to 94% from 85% in the prior period, the company said.
Refinery throughput averaged 796,000 barrels per day, up from 698,000 bpd in the prior quarter.
The refiner is battling possible seizure by creditors seeking to collect on unpaid PDVSA and Venezuela debts. A U.S. judge this month ruled he could take preliminary steps to auction shares to satisfy a $1.2 billion award against Citgo's parent.
""Winter storm Uri was a significant obstacle for our Corpus Christi refinery and contributed to a challenging start to 2021,"" said Chief Executive Carlos Jorda in a statement.
""As the first quarter comes to a close our industry is dealing with the effects of the recent events in Ukraine, which clearly illustrates the need for a reliable, secure supply,"" he added.
A high-level meeting between U.S. and Venezuelan officials in Caracas this month opened the door for talks over sanctions imposed on PDVSA since 2019, which could lead to Venezuelan crude returning to the U.S. market.

- Companies
June 28 (Reuters) - Top Goldman Sachs rainmaker Michael Carr, a veteran banker who advised on some of the biggest corporate takeovers in history and oversaw a boom in dealmaking at Wall Street's premier investment bank, is retiring from the firm.
Carr, who became co-chair of the bank's global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) business during a leadership reshuffle in 2020, led Goldman's powerhouse advisory group during an era that witnessed an unprecedented takeover boom.
During his tenure, Goldman advised on mega deals including the $130 billion tie-up between U.S. chemical giants DuPont and Dow Chemical Co and AbbVie's $63 billion deal for Botox maker Allergan.

268,"'Our champion': deported Djokovic welcomed home after Australian fiasco
- Summary
- Thwarted tennis player back in Belgrade from Australia
- Djokovic denied bid for 21st Grand Slam in vaccine row
- Serbian supporters chant his name, decry his deportation
- French Open also now in doubt for Djokovic
BELGRADE/MELBOURNE, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Novak Djokovic returned to a rapturous welcome in Serbia on Monday after Australia deported the world men's tennis No. 1 for being unvaccinated against COVID-19, a stance jeopardising his quest for a record 21st Grand Slam title.
Most Australians had wanted him gone, but Serbian fans cheered and waved national flags as Djokovic touched down at Belgrade airport then headed to his own apartment.
""You are our champion, Novak!"" and ""We love you, Nole!"" they chanted, using an affectionate diminutive.
The 34-year-old ""King of Melbourne"" had won nine previous Australia Opens, is level with Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer on 20 titles, and was top men's seed for the tournament that got underway on Monday.
But instead of beginning his title defence as scheduled at Melbourne Park, he flew to Belgrade via Dubai after being twice detained in a hotel with asylum-seekers and then unceremoniously booted out by Australian immigration.
""Whoever wins it now, doesn't really count,"" said Alek Drakoo, a member of the Australian Serbian community, disappointed to miss seeing him in Melbourne. read more
The Australian government's decision was in tune with majority public opinion, but authorities drew flak for the chaotic handling of the issue.
""I am uncomfortable that the focus of the past weeks has been on me and I hope that we can all now focus on the game and the tournament I love,"" Djokovic said, expressing disappointment but respect for a court decision against him.
BACK TO AUSTRALIA?
Under Australian law, he cannot return for three years unless the immigration minister accepts there are compelling or compassionate reasons. Prime Minister Scott Morrison hinted there may be a way to let him in next year.
""There is the opportunity for (a person) to return in the right circumstances, and that will be considered at the time,"" he told 2GB radio.
France said Djokovic would be barred from playing the French Open in May as things stand because of a new vaccine pass law.
""This will apply to everyone who is a spectator or a professional sportsperson,"" the ministry said in a statement.
It said, however, that the pandemic situation could change by then. read more

Tennis - Wimbledon - All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, Britain - June 27, 2022 Spain's Carlos Alcaraz celebrates after winning his first round match against Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff REUTERS/Matthew Childs
LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - It might not have been the workout Carlos Alcaraz was hoping for as he nursed a sore elbow but the Spaniard showed why he is considered the next big thing as he toppled Jan-Lennard Struff 4-6 7-5 4-6 7-6(3) 6-4 in the Wimbledon first round.
The 19-year-old has enjoyed an incredible season on clay and hardcourts -- winning titles in Rio, Miami, Barcelona and Madrid -- and on Monday he proved he has the skills and mental belief to succeed on the sport's slickest surface.
Despite still being a grasscourt novice, fifth seed Alcaraz did not let German Struff's 218kph hurtling serves or the disappointment of losing two of the opening three sets faze him.
Facing an opponent he described as ""big serve, big shots"", Alcaraz kept his nerve to fire down 30 aces and produced an assortment of breathtaking passing shots to secure only his second ever win on grass.
""I feel pretty good, playing here is amazing,"" the beaming teenager, whose debut appearance at Wimbledon ended in the second round 12 months ago, told the crowd.
""I didn't expect to move as well as I did today. I don't know how I did this (hit 30 aces) as this is probably my best match serving.
""This means I like to play on grass and I don't want to leave the court.""
In their only previous meeting, Struff beat Alcaraz in straight sets in the third round at last year's Roland Garros. But since that showdown, their careers have headed in opposite directions.

MILAN, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Italy's biggest banking group Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) could help fund Novatek's Arctic LNG 2 project even as some European governments show lukewarm support for the giant Russian gas project.
""We are studying the dossier ... though no decision has as yet been taken,"" Antonio Fallico, chairman of group unit Banca Intesa Russia, told Reuters on Wednesday.
Fallico said the bank had been invited to look at the financing deal by SACE, the state-owned Italian export credit agency.

""If the bank decides this project does not breach our policy in some way we'll do it,"" he said.
In September, Novatek CEO Leonid Mikhelson voiced concern that European governments were not keen on helping the company in the face of environmental opposition.
A group of mostly Green Party lawmakers from the European Parliament in May urged the leaders of Germany, France and Italy not to support the project due to climate change concerns. read more
""This project is 96-97% decarbonised ... we're talking of gas, not oil,"" Fallico said.
Earlier this year, Novatek shareholders approved external financing of $11 billion for the Arctic project, expected to start production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2023.
The $21 billion project, which received final investment approval in 2019, is expected to reach full capacity of almost 20 million tonnes per year in 2026.
In October, top management at Russia's largest LNG producer visited Rome to canvass support.
Mikhelson said in September Novatek had credit lines open for a third of the total financing from Russian banks, adding Chinese and Japanese banks could provide the rest.
The pressure on institutional investors from climate lobby groups to stop funding fossil fuel companies has intensified markedly in recent years.

277,"Kanye West’s 2020 official mission answered to political decision controllers Tuesday that somebody took huge number of dollars from the gathering’s records in a demonstration of “outside misrepresentation.”
The rapper’s bombed crusade, which actually exists as a lawful substance called “Kanye 2020,” recorded a divulgence with the Federal Election Commission, got by Billboard, that said it had unintentionally offered $3,999 in real money across three separate exchanges throughout the course of recent months.
“Subsequent to examining, it was resolved that an individual not associated with the mission got to a mission record to pay his own charge card,” the gathering composed. “It was accounted for to First Bank of Wyoming and a stop-pay was set up to safeguard against future unapproved charges. The bank couldn’t invert the exchanges at issue.”
The divulgence came after the FEC controllers sent a “Solicitation for Additional Information” to the mission about the three exchanges. The repercussions of the episode, for the mission or for the person who purportedly took the cash, are muddled. A rep for West didn’t promptly return a solicitation for input.

Sent off in July 2020, West’s mission for the administration never fully made headway. He just qualified for polling form access in twelve states and, regardless of encouraging fans on Twitter to project write-in votes in favor of him, the rapper just won approximately 70,000 decisions on Election Day.

The rapper’s bombed crusade, which actually exists as a lawful substance called “Kanye 2020,” recorded a divulgence with the Federal Election Commission, got by Billboard, that said it had unintentionally offered $3,999 in real money across three separate exchanges throughout the course of recent months.
“Subsequent to examining, it was resolved that an individual not associated with the mission got to a mission record to pay his own charge card,” the gathering composed. “It was accounted for to First Bank of Wyoming and a stop-pay was set up to safeguard against future unapproved charges. The bank couldn’t invert the exchanges at issue.”
The divulgence came after the FEC controllers sent a “Solicitation for Additional Information” to the mission about the three exchanges. The repercussions of the episode, for the mission or for the person who purportedly took the cash, are muddled. A rep for West didn’t promptly return a solicitation for input.

Sent off in July 2020, West’s mission for the administration never fully made headway. He just qualified for polling form access in twelve states and, regardless of encouraging fans on Twitter to project write-in votes in favor of him, the rapper just won approximately 70,000 decisions on Election Day.

BEIJING, Oct 18 (Reuters) - China's coking coal and coke futures jumped about 9% on Monday to record highs, as supply remains tight even though Beijing has ramped up efforts to boost output.
The most-traded coking coal futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange , for January delivery, surged as much as 9% to 3,869 yuan ($601.24) a tonne before closing up 8.4% at 3,847 yuan per tonne.
Coke futures hit their daily trading limit, up 9% at 4,344 yuan per tonne.
""Coke prices were mainly supported by raw material coking coal,"" said Tang Binghua, an analyst with Founder CIFCO Futures, adding there was still supply crunch for coking and thermal coal.
""The (tight supply) situation has not eased yet, especially as the government needs to ensure heating demand during winter.""
China's coal production stood at 334.1 million tonnes in September, compared with 335.24 million tonnes in August and down 0.9% on an annual basis, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.

TOKYO, July 3 (Reuters) - A fire caused Japan's biggest power generator JERA to shut down a 500 megawatt (MW) unit at its Chiba thermal power station near Tokyo on Saturday, raising fears of an electricity crunch as a prolonged heatwave keeps demand at high levels.

- Summary
- Companies
- IEA members to release 240 mln barrels over 6 months
- US dollar set to rise for 8th day to most since May 2020
- EU drafting proposals for an oil embargo on Russia
- China oil demand seen lower, Shanghai eases lockdowns
NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell about 4% on Monday, with Brent crude tumbling below $100 a barrel on worries that the COVID-19 pandemic will cut demand in China and as International Energy Agency (IEA) countries plan to release record volumes of oil from strategic stocks.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) closed at its lowest since Feb. 25, the day after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, an action Moscow calls a ""special military operation.""
Brent futures fell $4.30, or 4.2%, to settle at $98.48 a barrel, while WTI crude fell $3.97, or 4.0%, to settle at $94.29. It was the lowest close for Brent since March 16.
Fuel consumption in China, the world's biggest oil importer, has stalled with COVID-19 lockdowns in Shanghai, analysts at the Eurasia Group consultancy said. Shanghai, China's financial center, started easing lockdowns in some areas on Monday despite reporting a record of more than 25,000 new COVID-19 infections. read more
""Even when the restrictions in Shanghai are lifted, China's zero-Covid policies will likely remain a drag on demand,"" Eurasia Group said, noting Shanghai lockdowns likely reduced China's overall oil consumption by up to 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd).
To help offset a shortfall in Russian crude after Moscow was hit with sanctions, IEA member nations, including the United States, will release 240 million barrels of oil over the next six months. read more
The release of Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) volumes equals 1.3 million bpd over the next six months, enough to offset a shortfall of 1 million bpd of Russian oil supply, analysts at JP Morgan said.
""The (SPR) release will be the largest of all time, and has already broken the back of the WTI price curve,"" said Robert Yawger, executive director of energy futures at Mizuho, noting the spreads were sliding toward contango.
Contango signals an oversupplied market. It is when prices for later-dated months are higher than the front-month.
In contrast, when concerns about supply shortages were high in early March, the WTI curve was in what Yawger called ""super-backwardation"" with each month at least $1 a barrel below the prior month through November 2023.

283,"Croatia edge Serbia to reach Davis Cup final
MADRID, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Croatia reached the Davis Cup final after Nikola Mektic and Mate Pavic beat Novak Djokovic and Filip Krajinovic 7-5 6-1 in a decisive doubles clash to give the competition's twice former winners a 2-1 win over Serbia on Friday.
The Croatians will clash in Sunday's showpiece with either Germany or the Russian Tennis Federation, who meet in the other semi-final on Saturday.
Borna Gojo fired Croatia ahead with a 4-6 6-3 6-2 win over Dusan Lajovic in the opening rubber before Djokovic redressed the balance as he brushed aside Marin Cilic 6-4 6-2.
Krajinovic's late inclusion in the crunch encounter was a surprise move by Serbia's team captain Viktor Troicki, who left out the team's only doubles specialist Nikola Cacic.
The Serbians held their own against the world number one pairing of Mektic and Pavic early on but Krajinovic faltered in the final game of the opening set, as he dropped serve when Mektic rifled a forehand down the middle.
The superior movement and volleying of Mektic and Pavic made the difference as their class showed in the second set, with the Serbian duo fizzling out after a bright start.
""It's a great win against a tough team,"" Pavic said after the Croatian danced in delight on the court. ""We are super happy to be in the final and we're ready.""
Mektic added: ""Novak showed why he is the best player in the world but there are four people on the court in the doubles and we played an amazing match.
""They served really well in the first set but we took advantage of their level dropping a little bit in the second.""
DRIVING SEAT
Gojo put Croatia in the driving seat when he beat Lajovic after a magnificent fight back gave the world number 279 his third win of this year's competition against better-ranked opponents.
The outcome proved to be crucial in the tie as Gojo overpowered world number 33 Lajovic, emerging as the ace up team captain Vedran Martic's sleeve in Croatia's run to the final.
Lajovic seemed to have gained the upper hand when he rallied to take the opening set as he battled back from 4-2 and 40-down on Gojo's serve, but the 23-year old Croatian was unfazed and turned the tide emphatically.

285,"Trump incited Jan. 6 attack after 'unhinged' White House meeting, panel told
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday accused Donald Trump of inciting a mob of followers to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a last-ditch bid to remain in power fueled by a chaotic meeting with some of his most ardent supporters.
The House of Representatives committee also produced evidence that aides and outside agitators knew before the riot that Trump would urge thousands of his supporters to march on the Capitol that day.
The panel's seven Democrats and two Republicans have used the hearings to build a case that Trump's efforts to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election constitute illegal conduct, far beyond normal politics.
As the three-hour hearing ended, Republican Representative Liz Cheney said Trump had tried to phone a potential committee witness, raising the possibility he might have illegally tried to influence witness testimony. read more
In video testimony shown during the hearing, witnesses described a loud late-night six-hour meeting on Dec. 18, 2020, where Trump disregarded White House staffers who urged him to concede the November 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden.
Instead, Trump sided with outside advisers who urged him to keep pressing his baseless claims of election fraud.
Committee members said Trump ultimately was responsible for the chaos that followed.
""President Trump is a 76-year-old man. He is not an impressionable child. ... He is responsible for his own actions and his own choices,"" said Cheney, the committee vice chairperson.
Committee members said Trump incited the riot through his refusal to admit he lost the election and through comments like his Dec. 19, 2020, Twitter post, shortly after the meeting, for supporters to flock to Washington for a ""big protest,"" saying, ""Be there, will be wild.""
Trump, a Republican who has hinted he will seek the White House again in 2024, denies wrongdoing and has falsely asserted that he lost only because of widespread fraud that benefited Biden, a Democrat.
'NOT TOUGH ENOUGH'
The committee played recorded testimony from White House aides describing the angry Dec. 18 meeting where a handful of Trump's outside advisers, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, attorney Sidney Powell and Patrick Byrne, former chief executive of Overstock.com, encouraged him to fight the election result.
""I don't think any of these people were providing the president with good advice. I didn't understand how they had gotten in,"" Pat Cipollone, Trump's former White House counsel, said in video testimony.

Doug Mills/Pool via REUTERS
Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democratic committee member, displayed a text from White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who gave explosive testimony last month, saying of the meeting, ""The West Wing is unhinged.""
Giuliani, who was escorted from the White House grounds, said in video testimony his argument had been: ""You guys are not tough enough. Or maybe I put it another way: You're a bunch of pussies, excuse the expression. I'm almost certain the word was used.""
The attack on the Capitol, following a speech Trump gave at a rally outside the White House, delayed certification of Biden's election for hours, injured more than 140 police officers and led to several deaths.
'A MOB WAS BEING ORGANIZED'

WASHINGTON, July 12 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday accused Donald Trump of inciting a mob of followers to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a last-ditch bid to remain in power fueled by a chaotic meeting with some of his most ardent supporters.
The House of Representatives committee also produced evidence that aides and outside agitators knew before the riot that Trump would urge thousands of his supporters to march on the Capitol that day.
The panel's seven Democrats and two Republicans have used the hearings to build a case that Trump's efforts to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election constitute illegal conduct, far beyond normal politics.
As the three-hour hearing ended, Republican Representative Liz Cheney said Trump had tried to phone a potential committee witness, raising the possibility he might have illegally tried to influence witness testimony. read more
In video testimony shown during the hearing, witnesses described a loud late-night six-hour meeting on Dec. 18, 2020, where Trump disregarded White House staffers who urged him to concede the November 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden.
Instead, Trump sided with outside advisers who urged him to keep pressing his baseless claims of election fraud.
Committee members said Trump ultimately was responsible for the chaos that followed.
""President Trump is a 76-year-old man. He is not an impressionable child.... He is responsible for his own actions and his own choices,"" said Cheney, the committee vice chairperson.
Committee members said Trump incited the riot through his refusal to admit he lost the election and through comments like his Dec. 19, 2020, Twitter post, shortly after the meeting, for supporters to flock to Washington for a ""big protest,"" saying, ""Be there, will be wild.""
Trump, a Republican who has hinted he will seek the White House again in 2024, denies wrongdoing and has falsely asserted that he lost only because of widespread fraud that benefited Biden, a Democrat.
'NOT TOUGH ENOUGH'
The committee played recorded testimony from White House aides describing the angry Dec. 18 meeting where a handful of Trump's outside advisers, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, attorney Sidney Powell and Patrick Byrne, former chief executive of Overstock.com, encouraged him to fight the election result.
""I don't think any of these people were providing the president with good advice. I didn't understand how they had gotten in,"" Pat Cipollone, Trump's former White House counsel, said in video testimony.

Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democratic committee member, displayed a text from White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who gave explosive testimony last month, saying of the meeting, ""The West Wing is unhinged.""
Giuliani, who was escorted from the White House grounds, said in video testimony his argument had been: ""You guys are not tough enough. Or maybe I put it another way: You're a bunch of pussies, excuse the expression. I'm almost certain the word was used.""
The attack on the Capitol, following a speech Trump gave at a rally outside the White House, delayed certification of Biden's election for hours, injured more than 140 police officers and led to several deaths.
'A MOB WAS BEING ORGANIZED'
The committee presented evidence that it said showed Trump's call for his supporters to march on the Capitol was not spontaneous but had been planned in advance.

MADRID, July 8 (Reuters) - The Bank of Spain has registered the local unit of the world's largest crypto exchange Binance as a virtual currency platform with procedures in place against money laundering and financing of terrorism.
The bank said that registered providers have to comply with rules concerning money laundering and terrorism financing but added that it does not supervise the platforms' financial and operating risks, and that being included in the registry does not imply an approval of its activities by the central bank.
Binance, which has about 120 million users worldwide, tweeted on Friday that its registry in Spain will allow it to offer crypto asset exchange and custody in the country in compliance with the central bank's rules.
The registration signals that Binance is gaining momentum in Europe after France and Italy also included it in its national registries in recent months as the European Union prepares new regulation on the sector.
Cryptocurrency companies will need a licence and customer safeguards to issue and sell digital tokens in the European Union under new rules agreed last week by the bloc to tame a volatile market. read more
Under current rules, there is no cross-border approval of crypto services across the EU, but that will change with new rules due later on in 2023.
Globally, crypto assets are largely unregulated, with national operators in the European Union only required to show controls for combating money laundering.

FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried poses for a picture, in an unspecified location, in this undated handout picture, obtained by Reuters on July 5, 2022. FTX/Handout via REUTERS
July 6 (Reuters) - Sam Bankman-Fried, head of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX, said he and his company still have a ""few billion"" on hand to shore up struggling firms that could further destabilize the digital asset industry, but that the worst of the liquidity crunch has likely passed.
Bankman-Fried, 30, who is from California but lives in the Bahamas where FTX is based, has become crypto's white knight in recent weeks, throwing lifelines to digital asset platforms which have faltered as cryptocurrencies prices have cratered. Bitcoin is down around 70% from its all-time November high of nearly $69,000.
""We're starting to get a few more companies reaching out to us,"" Bankman-Fried said in an interview. Those firms are generally not in dire situations, though some smaller crypto exchanges may still fail, he said, adding that the industry has moved beyond ""other big shoes that have to drop.""
Bankman-Fried's crypto-trading firm, Alameda Research, gave crypto-lender Voyager Digital (VOYG.TO) a $200 million cash and stablecoin revolving credit facility, and a facility of bitcoin, as the company faced losses from exposure to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. On Wednesday, Voyager filed for bankruptcy. read more
Also in June, FTX handed U.S. cryptocurrency lender BlockFi a $250 million revolving credit facility and on Friday announced a deal giving FTX the right to purchase it based on certain performance triggers. read more
The goal of the bailouts was to protect customer assets and stop contagion from ricocheting through the system, Bankman-Fried said.
""Having trust with consumers that things will work as advertised is incredibly important and if broken is incredibly hard to get back,"" he said.
In January, FTX unveiled FTX Ventures, a $2 billion venture capital fund focused on digital asset investments, which it has since drawn on to help bail out firms that are lacking liquidity, but not assets.
.
Bankman-Fried also in May revealed he had personally taken a 7.6% stake in Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD.O), capitalizing on the trading app's weakened share price. read more
Forbes pegged Bankman-Fried’s net worth this year at around $24 billion, but Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index in May said that figure has been cut in half due to the crypto crash.
CRYPTO WINTER
As the U.S. Federal Reserve has begun aggressively hiking rates to combat hyperinflation, investors have fled the crypto markets.
The crash in cryptocurrency prices, referred to as ""crypto winter,"" may have bottomed, as prices have stabilized, but it will largely depend on the macro-economic situation, said Bankman-Fried, a 2014 graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
""I don't think it's an existential threat to the industry, but I do think it is a fair bit worse that I would have anticipated,"" Bankman-Fried said.
Bankman-Fried started his career in finance at quantitative trading firm Jane Street, then founded crypto trading firm Alameda Research and in 2019 set up FTX, which was valued in January at $32 billion. read more
He has said he plans to give away 99% of his wealth, and that he could spend up to $100 million supporting candidates in the 2024 election cycle, focusing on issues like pandemic prevention and bipartisanship.

July 6 (Reuters) - Sam Bankman-Fried, head of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX, said he and his company still have a ""few billion"" on hand to shore up struggling firms that could further destabilize the digital asset industry, but that the worst of the liquidity crunch has likely passed.
Bankman-Fried, 30, who is from California but lives in the Bahamas where FTX is based, has become crypto's white knight in recent weeks, throwing lifelines to digital asset platforms which have faltered as cryptocurrencies prices have cratered. Bitcoin is down around 70% from its all-time November high of nearly $69,000.
""We're starting to get a few more companies reaching out to us,"" Bankman-Fried said in an interview. Those firms are generally not in dire situations, though some smaller crypto exchanges may still fail, he said, adding that the industry has moved beyond ""other big shoes that have to drop.""
Bankman-Fried's crypto-trading firm, Alameda Research, gave crypto-lender Voyager Digital (VOYG.TO) a $200 million cash and stablecoin revolving credit facility, and a facility of bitcoin, as the company faced losses from exposure to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. On Wednesday, Voyager filed for bankruptcy. read more
Also in June, FTX handed U.S. cryptocurrency lender BlockFi a $250 million revolving credit facility and on Friday announced a deal giving FTX the right to purchase it based on certain performance triggers. read more
The goal of the bailouts was to protect customer assets and stop contagion from ricocheting through the system, Bankman-Fried said.
""Having trust with consumers that things will work as advertised is incredibly important and if broken is incredibly hard to get back,"" he said.
In January, FTX unveiled FTX Ventures, a $2 billion venture capital fund focused on digital asset investments, which it has since drawn on to help bail out firms that are lacking liquidity, but not assets.
.
Bankman-Fried also in May revealed he had personally taken a 7.6% stake in Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD.O), capitalizing on the trading app's weakened share price. read more
Forbes pegged Bankman-Fried’s net worth this year at around $24 billion, but Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index in May said that figure has been cut in half due to the crypto crash.
CRYPTO WINTER
As the U.S. Federal Reserve has begun aggressively hiking rates to combat hyperinflation, investors have fled the crypto markets.
The crash in cryptocurrency prices, referred to as ""crypto winter,"" may have bottomed, as prices have stabilized, but it will largely depend on the macro-economic situation, said Bankman-Fried, a 2014 graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
""I don't think it's an existential threat to the industry, but I do think it is a fair bit worse that I would have anticipated,"" Bankman-Fried said.
Bankman-Fried started his career in finance at quantitative trading firm Jane Street, then founded crypto trading firm Alameda Research and in 2019 set up FTX, which was valued in January at $32 billion. read more
He has said he plans to give away 99% of his wealth, and that he could spend up to $100 million supporting candidates in the 2024 election cycle, focusing on issues like pandemic prevention and bipartisanship.

297,"Myanmar to skip ASEAN ministerial meeting, Cambodia says
PHNOM PENH, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Cambodia said on Tuesday that Myanmar had confirmed its absence from this week's meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a day after its ruling military criticised neighbours for insisting its generals are not invited.
""No representative from Myanmar, already confirmed,"" Chum Sounry, foreign ministry spokesman of ASEAN chair Cambodia, said in a text message to Reuters when asked about Thursday's foreign ministers' retreat.
The military, which seized power in Myanmar a year ago, said late on Monday the continued actions of some ASEAN members in sidelining the army leadership and inviting only junior representatives were in conflict with the bloc's principles.

302,"Turkey says Deutsche Welle, others must obtain licences or have access blocked
ANKARA, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Turkey's broadcasting watchdog has given three international news agencies 72 hours to obtain an operating licence or else have access to their platforms blocked, one of its members said on Wednesday.
Ilhan Tasci criticised the move by the Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTUK) to request licences from the Turkish language websites of German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, Voice of America and Euronews, saying it marked a further assault on media freedom in Turkey.
""A decision was taken with a majority of votes that 72 hours be granted to the websites of amerikaninsesi.com, dw.com/tr, and tr.euronews.com to get licences,"" Tasci said in a tweet.
Tasci, one of nine members of the RTUK higher board, voted against it.
The RTUK board, which is dominated by the ruling AK Party, was not immediately available to comment on why it had requested the licences.
A spokesperson for Deutsche Welle said that they could not comment on the issue for the time being as there is no official information from RTUK on it yet.
Turkey has in recent years moved to increase media oversight by giving the RTUK oversight over all online content, which it also has the power to remove. About 90% of mainstream media in Turkey is now owned by the state or is close to the government. read more
Tasci, who is also an opposition lawmaker, said RTUK's real target was media freedom.
""After the national media, it is the turn of international news sites to be supervised and muzzled. With RTUK's 'there are videos on the site, it must get a licence' approach, there will be no unsupervised news outlets left,"" he said.

TOKYO, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Tuesday called on shareholders to recognise the importance of raising wages, making a clear push to address one of the chronic ailments of the world's no.3 economy: low pay.
Kishida also told a news conference that he would compile a policy package on Dec. 27 to allow small firms to pass on the cost wage hikes, adding it was important to take every possible step to encourage companies to raise wages.
After years of deflation, Japanese companies are wary of hiking prices for fear of losing customers and market share. Instead, they have typically turned to belt-tightening to keep costs down, leaving them with razor-thin margins and employees with flat pay.
Kishida, who has called for a ""new capitalism"", has made low wages one of his biggest points and called for a redistribution of wealth.

LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - Industrial metal prices have just seen their biggest quarter of falls in many years, with the market reflecting exposure to China's COVID lockdowns, inflation, rising interest rates and stalled growth.
The speed and magnitude of the fall was unexpected and partly reflects the sale of metal such as aluminium and nickel bought in anticipation of supply disruptions to material from Russia, which did not materialise, after it invaded Ukraine. read more

311,"Kraft has secret sauce in UK grocer food fight
Bottles of Heinz Tomato Ketchup, a brand owned by The Kraft Heinz Company, are seen in a store in Manhattan, New York, U.S., November 11, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly
LONDON, July 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Baked beans are a potent weapon in a food fight. Supermarkets like Britain’s Tesco (TSCO.L) are yanking Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) favourites like ketchup and canned vegetables over “unjustifiable” price hikes. The $47 billion U.S. company’s meatier margins make it a target for consumers and politicians trying to rein in soaring living costs. But in reducing its choices on offer, Tesco may be yielding ground to Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and cut-price rivals like Lidl and Aldi.
Alongside Tesco, Kraft Heinz is a goliath. Its market value is twice that of the UK’s leading grocer and its operating margin, at 20%, is five times as plump. Presumably Tesco Chief Executive Ken Murphy thinks such numbers make the supplier vulnerable. In a debate over who can stomach more of the pain from inflation, there’s little contest. To make the point, Murphy has stopped selling 16 Heinz products he thinks are too expensive. Ahold Delhaize (AD.AS), the Amsterdam-listed owner of U.S. chain Stop & Shop, pulled a similar move with Nestlé’s (NESN.S) KitKats and Nescafé earlier this year.
The grocers’ tough talk may go down well with customers. UK food inflation has soared to nearly 9%, and the Bank of England is warning of a potential recession. Supermarket chains can also fill the gaps with their own “white label” brands that are cheaper than the equivalents from giants like Kraft, Unilever (ULVR.L), Nestlé and Danone (DANO.PA). If Kraft refuses to back down, Tesco may end up selling more of its in-house produce.
The consumer giants still have reason to hold out. Around half the goods Tesco and its ilk sell are from big-name brands like Coca-Cola (KO.N) or Nestlé, Shore Capital analysts reckon. The supermarket chain’s 27% UK market share is based on its ability to sell a wide variety cheaply. If Kraft refuses to yield and Tesco enters similar disputes with other food giants, its shelves will quickly fill with little but its own cheap brands. That makes it look suspiciously like discount rivals Aldi and Lidl, whose shelves contain only 10%-15% of pricier international brands from Unilever, Kraft and the like.

“Capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. It’s exploitation,"" Biden said. ""That’s what we’re seeing in meat and poultry industries now.”
A recent White House analysis found that the top four meatpacker companies - Cargill (CARG.UL), Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N), JBS SA , and National Beef Packing Co (MRFG3.SA) - control between 55% and 85% of the market in the hog, cattle, and chicken sectors.
The Department of Agriculture (USDA) will spend the $1 billion from American Rescue Plan funds to expand the independent meat processing sector, including funds for financing grants, guaranteed loans, and worker training, said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who was speaking at an event with Biden.
USDA will also propose rules this year to strengthen enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act and to clarify the meaning of ""Product of USA"" meat labels, which domestic ranchers have said unfairly advantage multinational companies that raise cattle abroad and only slaughter in the United States.
Attorney General Merrick Garland, also speaking at the event, said “too many industries have become too consolidated over time,” and that the antitrust division of the Department of Justice has been chronically underfunded.

SEOUL, Oct 6 (Reuters) - South Korea will begin taking reservations for coronavirus vaccines from pregnant women this week as the country accelerates its inoculation drive to reach its goal for immunizing 80% of all adults by the end of the month.
Health authorities see pregnant mothers as key to the campaign and sought to drum up participation through public notices and news conferences saying they have a greater possibility of serious illness and death if infected with COVID-19.
Pregnant women are eligible to sign up for a shot starting Friday, for inoculation set to begin on Oct. 18 using Pfizer (PFE.N) or Moderna vaccines, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA).

322,"New Zealand to price sheep and cow burps to cut greenhouse gases
WELLINGTON, June 8 (Reuters) - New.
Nearly half its total greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, mainly methane, but agricultural emissions have previously been exempted from the country's emissions trading scheme, drawing criticism of the government's commitment to stop global warming.
Under the draft plan, put together by government and farm community representatives, farmers will have to pay for their gas emissions from 2025. Short-and long-lived farm gas will be priced separately, although a single measure to calculate their volume will be used.
""There is no question that we need to cut the amount of methane we are putting into the atmosphere, and an effective emissions pricing system for agriculture will play a key part in how we achieve that,"" Climate Change Minister James Shaw said.
The proposal includes incentives for farmers who reduce emissions through feed additives, while on-farm forestry can be used to offset emissions. Revenue from the scheme will be invested in research, development and advisory services for farmers.
""Our recommendations enable sustainable food and fibre production for future generations while playing a fair part in meeting our country's climate commitments,"" said Michael Ahie, chair of the primary sector partnership, He Waka Eke Noa.

Anti-abortion demonstrators and abortion rights supporters protest outside the U.S. Supreme Court the day after the United States Supreme Court ruled in the Dobbs v Women's Health Organization abortion case, overturning the landmark Roe v Wade abortion decision, in Washington, U.S., June 25, 2022. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz
June 25 (Reuters) - Anti-abortion activists should be concerned with other issues that can threaten life, such as easy access to guns, poverty and rising maternity mortality rates, the Vatican's editorial director said on Saturday.
In a media editorial on the United States Supreme Court's ruling to end the constitutional right to abortion, Andrea Tornielli said those who oppose abortion could not pick and choose pro-life issues. read more
""Being for life, always, for example, means being concerned if the mortality rates of women due to motherhood increase,"" he wrote.
He cited statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing a rise in maternity mortality rates overall and that the rate was nearly three times higher for black women.
""Being for life, always, means asking how to help women welcome new life,"" he wrote, citing an unsourced statistic that 75% of women who have abortions live in poverty or are low-wage earners.
He also cited statistics from the Harvard Review of Psychiatry showing that the United States has much lower rates of paid parental leave compared with other rich nations.
""Being for life, always, also means defending it against the threat of firearms, which unfortunately have become a leading cause of death of children and adolescents in the U.S."" he wrote.
The Roman Catholic church teaches that abortion is murder because life begins at the moment of conception and ends with natural death.
Pope Francis has compared having an abortion to ""hiring a hit man"" to eliminate a problematic person.
But he has tried to steer the U.S. Catholic Church away from seeing abortion as the single, overarching life issue in the country's so-called culture wars.
The death penalty, gun control, support for families, and immigration are also life issues, he has said.

330,"Analysis: Best supporting actor? NATO in secondary role if Russia invades Ukraine
- Summary
- NATO to help Ukraine but not treaty-bound to defend it
- NATO has prioritised reinforcing the Baltics since 2014
- Chance of a 'spillover' in Black Sea region
- NATO wants more talks with Russia
BRUSSELS, Jan 18 (Reuters) -, some of the toughest decisions could fall on the European Union.
They include how to hit Moscow with any new economic sanctions, the fallout from any shortage of Russian natural gas to Europe and taking in refugees fleeing war.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has said that diplomacy last week over legally binding security demands had come to a ""dead end"". Envoys and experts are divided over whether Russia will invade Ukraine. read more
The Kremlin has massed 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, a buildup that the West says is preparation for a war to stop Ukraine ever joining NATO. Russia denies planning an invasion.
NATO is already intensifying the strategy it has employed since Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, with more defensive military planning, modernising deterrents, supporting Ukraine with cyberwarfare teams and seeking dialogue with Moscow.
As there is a risk of any conflict spilling over into NATO territory around the Black Sea, the alliance faces the dilemma of how much more to prepare and how to support Kyiv.
Even though NATO agreed at a summit in Bucharest in 2008 that Ukraine would one day become a NATO member, the alliance is not bound by its founding treaty to defend Ukraine.
U.S. President Joe Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troops to Ukraine to fight Russian soldiers.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Nov. 30: ""It is important to distinguish between NATO allies and partner Ukraine ... Ukraine is a partner, a highly valued partner.""
Two NATO diplomats said Western steps to support Ukraine could range from more U.S. weaponry and drones for the Ukrainian armed forces to intensified training of Ukrainian forces - especially in ways to react to any Russian missile attacks. Britain has begun supplying Ukraine with anti-tank weapons. read more
Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance would sign an agreement on closer cybersecurity cooperation with Kyiv in the coming days, without giving more details, after cyberattacks on Ukrainian government websites last week.

That would still be in defence of NATO territory, but would send a message of resolve to Russia.

SHANGHAI, March 16 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks jumped 9% on Wednesday to mark their best day since 2008, after China's top policymaker assured markets of stability and support and helped put a floor under sectors hurt by a regulatory crackdown.
Vice Premier Liu He said Beijing would roll out support for the Chinese economy as well as be cautious with measures for capital markets.
The Xinhua news agency also cited Liu as saying, at a meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Committee under the State Council, that regulators would coordinate better with their counterparts in Hong Kong.
The comments came a day after China stocks slumped to 21-month lows and mainland firms listed in Hong Kong plumbed 2008 lows.
Chinese stocks have been pummelled this year by rising domestic COVID-19 cases, fears about a blowback on China from its dealings with the sanctions-hit Russia, and continued regulatory crackdowns, including the risk of more mainland firms being delisted by U.S. exchanges.
Liu's assurances helped the Hang Seng index (.HSI) claw back all the ground lost on Tuesday and more. The HSI surged more than 9% to above the 20,000-point mark.
The Hang Seng Tech Index (.HSTECH) logged its biggest daily gain of 22%, recovering a good deal of the ground it had ceded since March 10 as regulatory fears piled up.
""It's quite positive, at least for the moment, as Liu addressed some key concerns in the market, especially regarding the regulatory crackdown,"" said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura. ""Liu also demands the PBOC to take action, so I believe the PBOC will do some easing in the next couple of months.""
The blue-chip CSI300 index (.CSI300) gained the most since July 2020, rising 4.3%, while the Shanghai Composite Index (.SSEC) added 3.5% and the Hong Kong-listed China Enterprises Index (.HSCE) gained 12.5%.
The CSI300 had lost 19% in the year to date through Tuesday's close.
Among Hong Kong index heavyweights, Meituan (3690.HK) jumped 32.1%, while Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) and Alibaba Group (9988.HK) soared 23% and 27%, respectively, logging their biggest daily gains.

332,"North Korea gets offers of aid to fight COVID as it lacks vaccines

SEOUL, May 13 (Reuters) - North Korea is facing its first confirmed COVID-19 outbreak with no known vaccine programme, sparking new calls for the government to accept aid that could save lives, help protect its battered economy, and possibly lead to a diplomatic opening.
The office of South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol said on Friday it intends to help the North, including by providing vaccines, and that specific measures would be discussed with Pyongyang.
North Korea is not known to have imported or administered any COVID-19 vaccines, and is one of only two countries that haven't begun a vaccination campaign. Until Thursday's reports by state news agency KCNA, it had never reported a confirmed case of the disease.
Its unexpected admission that infections were ""exploding"" across the nation led some observers to hope that Pyongyang might soon accept vaccines.
“Unveiling the outbreak through KCNA, which is a primary channel for external communications, indicates that North Korea could seek vaccine support,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. ""Isolation and control are not enough to overcome the crisis without vaccines.""
Others said that it remains unclear whether North Korea's stance is softening, and that there are many hurdles with geopolitical implications.
Some analysts argue that ""vaccine diplomacy"" with North Korea could ease tensions in other areas such as the country's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
""If inter-Korean cooperation does happen, it would help defuse military tension and reopen talks, and potentially lead to humanitarian exchanges such as a reunion of separated families,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, director of the Sejong Institute's North Korea studies centre in South Korea.
But the politicization of aid may also be a major reason why North Korea has been hesitant to accept.
Pyongyang might be more likely to reach out to its allies in Beijing first, Cheong said, though Pyongyang turned down an earlier offer of 3 million COVID-19 vaccine doses of China's Sinovac Biotech.
""If the situation gets more uncontrollable, it would be difficult to refuse Western support,"" he said.
Authorities in Pyongyang appeared suspicious that they would only get a limited amount of vaccine and then to be under pressure to accept more, an independent U.N. human rights investigator said in February.
South Korean officials have said that the North did not want Sinovac or British-Swedish Astrazeneca shots, preferring the U.S.-made Moderna and Pfizer instead, and that talks with the global vaccine-sharing scheme COVAX had stalled because the North refused to agree to indemnity clauses regarding side effects.
""But that was before the outbreak, and now they’re in an emergency,"" Kwon Young-se, South Korea's nominee to be the unification minister responsible for inter-Korean ties, told a parliamentary confirmation hearing on Thursday.

336,"U.S. largest pension funds CalPERS and CalSTRS exposed to Russian assets
NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), the two largest U.S. pensions funds, have exposure to Russian assets, which have come under pressure after Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday, according to statements from the funds.
A spokesperson for CalPERS, which manages the largest U.S. public pension fund, said late on Thursday that the fund had around $900 million of exposure to Russia, but no Russian debt.
The spokesperson did not elaborate on the breakdown of the Russian assets and declined to comment on potential plans to trim those allocations.
CalSTRS, the second-largest U.S. pension fund, said it had investments in Russia and was monitoring potential risks to its portfolio. Its exposure to Russian assets was worth over $800 million in June last year, according to the latest available data and Reuters calculations.
CalPERS manages nearly $500 billion in assets, while CalSTRS has assets totalling around $320 billion.
""CalSTRS will follow any relevant financial sanctions levied by the United States Government,"" a spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

Yields on Russian benchmark 10-year OFZ rouble bonds , which move inversely to prices, rose to 14.09% on Thursday, their highest since early 2015, though the bonds pared back some losses on Friday. The dollar-denominated RTS stock index (.IRTS) rose sharply on Friday but still stood near a two-year low.
According to the latest available data on its website and Reuters calculations, CalSTRS had exposure to nine Russian local sovereign bonds, so-called OFZs, with a market value of nearly $32 million as of June. Its holdings of Russian roubles had a market value of about $1.5 million at that time.
On the equity side, its allocations were worth around $800 million in June and included securities issued by energy companies like Gazprom and Lukoil, as well as by sanctions-hit Russian banks Sberbank and VTB.

338,"Options market dip-buyers go missing as stock sell-off worsens
NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Traders in the options market showed little appetite to bet on an end to the continuing stock market sell-off on Monday, as Wall Street's most followed gauge of equity market fear soared to its highest level in more than a year.
The Cboe Volatility (.VIX) - the Wall Street fear gauge - was recently up 9.14 points to 37.99, its highest since November 2020 as worries over a more hawkish Federal Reserve and a Russian attack on Ukraine put the S&P 500 (.SPX) on course to close down more than 10% from its recent high.
Even as stocks tumbled, however, there were few signs in the options market that traders were expecting the sell-off to abate soon.
""I am not seeing much along the line of 'quick end to the sell-off',"" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group.
""It still looks pretty fearful,"" Murphy said.

""Buying the dip"" has been a particularly well-rewarded strategy in recent years, where traders in stocks and options have profited handsomely from betting on a rapid rebound anytime stocks stumbled.
While there were some stray bets on upside Monday, more broadly, traders appeared to be staying away from dip-buying, Susquehanna's Murphy said.
Schwab's Frederick said last week's price action when stocks rose early on some days only to give up those gains and more later in the session might be keeping investors from placing upside bets.
""If I were a bargain hunter, I might be a little gun shy based on that,"" Frederick said.

March 10 (Reuters) - Japanese brands Uniqlo and Japan Tobacco made U-turns and said they were stopping business in Russia, joining the corporate crowd shunning Moscow on Thursday, and Britain escalated sanctions against oligarchs including Chelsea soccer club owner Roman Abramovich.
Investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) became the first U.S. bank to quit Russia, and global grain trader Bunge (BG.N) said it had suspended new export business from Russia, although it is still crushing oil seeds for the domestic market. read more .
Russian President Vladimir Putin said that his country would emerge stronger and more independent from Western sanctions, which he said were inevitable. The corporate condemnation of Russia's attack on Ukraine is spreading, but Putin, who calls the war a special military operation, said he had no choice.
The fallout is also broadening among Putin's personal allies, as Abramovich and six others including Igor Sechin, CEO of Russian energy giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM), became the highest-profile oligarchs sanctioned by Britain since the invasion.
The action effectively puts Chelsea under UK government control, halting any disposal, and stopping new ticket or merchandise sales. read more
Britain's move came as the first major mining company, Rio Tinto, (RIO.L)(RIO.AX) said it is cutting all ties with Russian businesses, including fuel and other materials' sources for its Mongolian copper operations at Oyu Tolgoi, where possible, and the use of an alumina refinery in Ireland. read more

The exodus by Japanese companies picked up steam, with many describing the decisions in practical terms.
Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing (9983.T) had told Japanese media that the company would continue operating its 50 stores in Russia because ""clothing is a necessity of life,"" but on Thursday the company said it could not continue business in Russia because of ""a number of difficulties.""

Investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) became the first U.S. bank to quit Russia, and global grain trader Bunge (BG.N) said it had suspended new export business from Russia, although it is still crushing oil seeds for the domestic market. read more.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said that his country would emerge stronger and more independent from Western sanctions, which he said were inevitable. The corporate condemnation of Russia's attack on Ukraine is spreading, but Putin, who calls the war a special military operation, said he had no choice.
The fallout is also broadening among Putin's personal allies, as Abramovich and six others including Igor Sechin, CEO of Russian energy giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM), became the highest-profile oligarchs sanctioned by Britain since the invasion.
The action effectively puts Chelsea under UK government control, halting any disposal, and stopping new ticket or merchandise sales. read more
Britain's move came as the first major mining company, Rio Tinto, (RIO.L)(RIO.AX) said it is cutting all ties with Russian businesses, including fuel and other materials' sources for its Mongolian copper operations at Oyu Tolgoi, where possible, and the use of an alumina refinery in Ireland. read more
Japan's Sony and Nintendo suspended deliveries of their gaming consoles; Sony's music businesses and Warner Music Group (WMG.O) also stopped business in Russia.
HOTELIERS STEP BACK
Major fast-food, drinks and consumer goods companies, led by McDonalds and Coca-Cola, have stepped back from Russia following pressure from customers in the West.
Hotelier Marriott International (MAR.O) closed its Moscow office and joined Hilton (HLT.N) and Hyatt (H.N) in suspending developments.
The exodus by Japanese companies picked up steam, with many describing the decisions in practical terms.
Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing (9983.T) had told Japanese media that the company would continue operating its 50 stores in Russia because ""clothing is a necessity of life,"" but on Thursday the company said it could not continue business in Russia because of ""a number of difficulties.""
Japan Tobacco, which controls about one-third of Russia's tobacco market, said its subsidiary would stop investment, marketing and a launch of a heated tobacco product. read more
Japan's Shiseido (4911.T) suspended exports of its cosmetics to Russia from Europe as well as advertising and promotions, and Mitsubishi Electric said it would stop exports to Russia, where operations were in a ""difficult situation"".
Japanese construction machinery supplier Hitachi said it would stop exports and cease most operations in Russia except for vital electrical power facilities, following similar exits by American industrial companies Caterpillar (CAT.N), 3M Co (MMM.N), Deere (DE.N) and Honeywell (HON.O).

- Summary
- Paper's former editor-in-chief of digital claims she was undermined after reporting harassment from her boss
- Suit says paper rehired the alleged harasser after he left over the complaints
(Reuters) - A former editor-in-chief of the New York Post's digital platform sued parent company News Corp on Tuesday, claiming she was fired after complaining that the newspaper’s former editor-in-chief sexually propositioned her.
Michelle Gotthelf alleges she was fired after a years-long campaign to undermine her authority that began when she complained about a 2015 incident with New York Post former editor-in-chief Col Allan.
Gotthelf's lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court alleges that she worked at the New York tabloid until Jan. 12, when the current editor-in-chief of the New York Post Group, Keith Poole, terminated her.
Allan could not be reached for comment.
A New York Post and News Corp spokesperson said in a statement that “any suggestion of wrongdoing"" related to the recent management changes was ""meritless.""
The lawsuit, which also names Allan, Poole and NYP Holdings Inc as defendants, alleges Gotthelf attended a dinner meeting in the fall of 2015 with the paper’s top editors where she said Allan asked her sexually charged questions and said ""we should sleep together.""
Gotthelf, who had worked at the publication since 2000, said she left the event and later mentioned what happened to some colleagues but did not report the incident to human resources. Allan’s treatment of her turned increasingly hostile, the lawsuit alleges, and Gotthelf later complained to human resources about his behavior. In 2016 Allan retired from his role at the paper – a move Gotthelf asserts was a result of her complaints.
The lawsuit says that in 2019 Allan was rehired as a consultant at the New York Post and that although Gotthelf negotiated as part of her contract to not report to Allan, he was soon supervising her work.
In January 2021 the paper hired News Corp veteran Keith Poole to take over as editor-in-chief of the New York Post Group, making him Gotthelf’s boss, the lawsuit alleges.

- Summary
- Lawmakers back 'green' EU investment label for the fuels
- Likely to become law unless super-majority of states veto
- Gas, nuclear rules have split EU countries and lawmakers
- Luxembourg, Austria to challenge law in court
BRUSSELS, July 6 (Reuters) - The European Parliament on Wednesday backed EU rules labelling investments in gas and nuclear power plants as climate-friendly, throwing out an attempt to block the law that has exposed deep rifts between countries over how to fight climate change.
The vote paves the way for the European Union proposal to pass into law, unless 20 of the bloc's 27 member states decide to oppose the move, which is seen as very unlikely.
The new rules will add gas and nuclear power plants to the EU ""taxonomy"" rulebook from 2023, enabling investors to label and market investments in them as green.
Out of 639 lawmakers present, 328 opposed a motion that sought to block the EU gas and nuclear proposals.
The European Commission welcomed the result. It proposed the rules in February after more than a year of delay and intense lobbying from governments and industries.
""The Complementary Delegated Act is a pragmatic proposal to ensure that private investments in gas and nuclear, needed for our energy transition, meet strict criteria,"" EU financial services chief Mairead McGuinness said.
The rules have split EU countries, lawmakers and investors. Brussels redrafted the rules multiple times, flip-flopping over whether to grant gas plants a green tag. Its final proposal fuelled fierce debate about how to hit climate goals amid a crisis over dwindling Russian gas supplies.

A fresh batch of strong results from companies including PayPal (PYPL.O) and CVS Health Corp boosted sentiment in a largely upbeat quarterly reporting season.

SHANGHAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Seasonally strong corporate demand supported the Chinese currency on Wednesday, but a softer daily fixing and a narrowing spread between Chinese and U.S. yields kept gains in check as the country's central bank flagged further easing.

354,"Get back to the office, Britain's business minister says
LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - People should get back to the office to benefit from in-person collaboration because the world must learn to live with the coronavirus after a pandemic that has wiped trillions of dollars off global output, Britain's business minister said on Friday.
After the novel coronavirus emerged in China in late 2019, work-from-home instructions across the world emptied office towers from Manhattan to Canary Wharf leaving millions toiling from home.
Juggling sometimes shaky home internet connections, frustrated lockdown children and unmuting - or not - on often meandering video calls with work colleagues became the norm for many office workers.
In England, British Prime Minister is scrapping COVID rules - and dropped work from home advice from Wednesday.
""We should get back to work,"" British Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told LBC radio. ""We've got to get back to some degree of normality.""
""People working in the office do get benefits from working with colleagues, being able to interact directly with them and I want to get back to a sense that, you know, that the pandemic is turning from a pandemic into an endemic,"" he said.
Johnson, betting that Omicron has peaked, says the world needs to live with COVID and that economies cannot remain shut for much longer. He has said London will recover as it learns to live with COVID.
""It's something we have to live with. And if we are going to live with it, I think the sooner we get back to the pre-Covid world the better in terms of workplace practices,"" Kwarteng said.
Kwarteng said he was trying to increase the number of people working back in government departments. He said around 50% of his department was back to work in person, though he cautioned he didn't have exact data.
Some bosses have urged people back to work. Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) CEO has called home working an ""aberration"" while Stuart Rose, chairman of supermarket group Asda, said he had been working at the office throughout the pandemic.
""I cannot believe we have a nation sitting at home now cowered by this government,"" Rose said. ""It is something we have to now live with.""
Other companies, especially in the technology sector, have offered hybrid working options - or full working from home - to those employees who have welcomed a reduction in commuting times and increased flexibility.

363,"Judge blocks U.S. COVID-19 vaccine rule for health workers in 10 states
Nov 29 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday blocked in 10 states a Biden administration vaccine requirement, finding the agency that issued the rule mandating healthcare workers get vaccinated against the coronavirus likely exceeded its authority.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Matthew Schelp in St. Louis prevents the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from enforcing its vaccine mandate for healthcare workers until the court can hear legal challenges brought by the 10 states.
CMS in a statement said it was reviewing the ruling, adding that unvaccinated healthcare staff pose a threat to patient safety.
The ruling is the second legal setback for President Joe Biden, who has focused on vaccines to halt the COVID-19 pandemic, a point he emphasized on Monday amid concerns about the spread of the new COVID-19 Omicron variant. read more
A federal appeals court in New Orleans earlier this month blocked a sweeping workplace mandate that requires businesses with at least 100 employees to get their staff vaccinated or tested weekly. read more
Republican state attorneys general sued the administration in early November over the CMS rule, seeking to block the requirement because they alleged it would worsen healthcare staffing shortages.
Schelp, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, said CMS had understated the ""overwhelming"" cost of its mandate and by declining to submit the rule to public comment the agency had fed the vaccine hesitancy the rule is meant to counter.
Schelp also said the CMS rule altered the balance of power between the federal and state governments.
""Congress did not clearly authorize CMS to enact this politically and economically vast, federalism-altering, and boundary-pushing mandate, which Supreme Court precedent requires,"" he wrote. healthcare providers including hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis centers.
The rule requires health facilities to mandate all employees, volunteers and contractors have a first vaccine dose by Dec. 6 and to be fully vaccinated by Jan. 4. Providers that fail to comply could lose access to Medicare and Medicaid funds.
Medicare serves people 65 and older and the disabled. Medicaid serves the poor.
In addition to the CMS rule and the workplace vaccine requirement, the Biden administration imposed coronavirus vaccine rules on government contractors, military personnel and federal employees, which are all being challenged in court.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Matthew Schelp in St. Louis prevents the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from enforcing its vaccine mandate for healthcare workers until the court can hear legal challenges brought by the 10 states.
CMS in a statement said it was reviewing the ruling, adding that unvaccinated healthcare staff pose a threat to patient safety.
The ruling is the second legal setback for President Joe Biden, who has focused on vaccines to halt the COVID-19 pandemic, a point he emphasized on Monday amid concerns about the spread of the new COVID-19 Omicron variant. read more
A federal appeals court in New Orleans earlier this month blocked a sweeping workplace mandate that requires businesses with at least 100 employees to get their staff vaccinated or tested weekly. read more
Republican state attorneys general sued the administration in early November over the CMS rule, seeking to block the requirement because they alleged it would worsen healthcare staffing shortages.
Schelp, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, said CMS had understated the ""overwhelming"" cost of its mandate and by declining to submit the rule to public comment the agency had fed the vaccine hesitancy the rule is meant to counter.
Schelp also said the CMS rule altered the balance of power between the federal and state governments.
""Congress did not clearly authorize CMS to enact this politically and economically vast, federalism-altering, and boundary-pushing mandate, which Supreme Court precedent requires,"" he wrote. healthcare providers including hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis centers.
The rule requires health facilities to mandate all employees, volunteers and contractors have a first vaccine dose by Dec. 6 and to be fully vaccinated by Jan. 4. Providers that fail to comply could lose access to Medicare and Medicaid funds.
Medicare serves people 65 and older and the disabled. Medicaid serves the poor.
In addition to the CMS rule and the workplace vaccine requirement, the Biden administration imposed coronavirus vaccine rules on government contractors, military personnel and federal employees, which are all being challenged in court.

CARACAS, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro on Sunday denounced members of the European Union's (EU) electoral observation mission who monitored voting last weekend as ""spies,"" and accused them of looking to ""stain"" the regional elections on their preliminary report.

- Summary

- Suspected missile launched from Pyongyang airport - S.Korea says
- U.S. condemns launch as violation of UNSC resolutions
- Debris landed in or near city - report
- N.Korea has been testing large ICBM system - U.S., S.Korea say
SEOUL, March 16 (Reuters) - North Korea launched a suspected missile that appeared to explode shortly after liftoff in the skies over Pyongyang on Wednesday, South Korea's military said, amid reports that the nuclear-armed North was seeking to test-fire its largest missile yet.
The United States and South Korea have warned that North Korea may be preparing to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) at full range for the first time since 2017, in violation of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. read more
The projectile was fired from the international airport in Sunan, outside the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement.
""It is presumed that it failed immediately after launch,"" the statement said. It was presumed to be a ballistic missile and seemed to explode in mid-air while still in its booster phase, at an altitude below 20 kilometres (12 miles), a JCS official told Reuters.
A U.S. Department of State spokesperson said it was a ""ballistic missile launch"" and condemned it as a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, but declined to comment when asked about the reported failure.
Debris fell in or near Pyongyang after the failed test, Seoul-based NK News reported, citing unnamed witnesses and a photograph of the test showing a red-tinted ball of smoke at the end of a zig-zagging plume that traced the rocket's launch trajectory in the sky above the city.
The failed launch underscored the danger behind North Korea's decision to use an airport so close to heavily populated civilian areas as a site for test firing large missiles, analysts said. read more
In 2017, an intermediate-range ballistic missile launched from another location in North Korea failed shortly after liftoff and crashed into an industrial or agriculture complex in the city of Tokchon.
The Sunan airport has been the site of several recent launches, including on Feb. 27 and March 5. North Korea said those tests were for developing components of a reconnaissance satellite and did not identify what rocket it used, but Seoul and Washington said they were tests of a new ICBM system.

""Our combined military forces provide a credible military deterrence to any adversary or threat who oppose us,"" LaCamera said, according to a statement released by USFK.
North Korea's newest and largest ICBM system, the Hwasong-17, was first unveiled at a military parade in 2020 and reappeared at a defence exhibition in October 2021.
The Feb. 27 and March 5 launches did not demonstrate the missile's full range, and analysts said the North might have used only one stage of the missile or adjusted its fuel volume to fly at lower altitudes.

SEOUL, March 16 (Reuters) - North Korea launched a suspected missile that appeared to explode shortly after liftoff in the skies over Pyongyang on Wednesday, South Korea's military said, amid reports that the nuclear-armed North was seeking to test-fire its largest missile yet.
The United States and South Korea have warned that North Korea may be preparing to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) at full range for the first time since 2017, in violation of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. read more
The projectile was fired from the international airport in Sunan, outside the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement.
""It is presumed that it failed immediately after launch,"" the statement said. It was presumed to be a ballistic missile and seemed to explode in mid-air while still in its booster phase, at an altitude below 20 kilometres (12 miles), a JCS official told Reuters.
A U.S. Department of State spokesperson said it was a ""ballistic missile launch"" and condemned it as a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, but declined to comment when asked about the reported failure.
Debris fell in or near Pyongyang after the failed test, Seoul-based NK News reported, citing unnamed witnesses and a photograph of the test showing a red-tinted ball of smoke at the end of a zig-zagging plume that traced the rocket's launch trajectory in the sky above the city.
The failed launch underscored the danger behind North Korea's decision to use an airport so close to heavily populated civilian areas as a site for test firing large missiles, analysts said. read more
In 2017, an intermediate-range ballistic missile launched from another location in North Korea failed shortly after liftoff and crashed into an industrial or agriculture complex in the city of Tokchon.
The Sunan airport has been the site of several recent launches, including on Feb. 27 and March 5. North Korea said those tests were for developing components of a reconnaissance satellite and did not identify what rocket it used, but Seoul and Washington said they were tests of a new ICBM system.
SERIES OF NEW MISSILE TESTS
Reclusive North Korea has fired missiles at an unprecedented frequency this year, conducting its ninth weapons test on March 5, drawing condemnation from the United States, South Korea and Japan. read more
The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier led military exercises in the Yellow Sea, and air defence artillery at Osan air base in South Korea intensified drills in response to the increased North Korean missile activity, U.S. forces in Asia said on Tuesday. read more
South Korean Defence Minister Suh Wook and U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Commander Gen. Paul LaCamera called for maintaining strong defence posture during Suh's visit to Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, the largest U.S. overseas military base.
""Our combined military forces provide a credible military deterrence to any adversary or threat who oppose us,"" LaCamera said, according to a statement released by USFK.
North Korea's newest and largest ICBM system, the Hwasong-17, was first unveiled at a military parade in 2020 and reappeared at a defence exhibition in October 2021.
The Feb. 27 and March 5 launches did not demonstrate the missile's full range, and analysts said the North might have used only one stage of the missile or adjusted its fuel volume to fly at lower altitudes.

376,"Facebook parent Meta set to raise $10 billion in bond debut
Aug 4 (Reuters) - Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) is set to raise $10 billion in its first-ever bond offering on Thursday, as it looks to fund share buybacks and investments to revamp its business, according to two sources close to the deal.
The offering, which included bonds with maturities ranging from five years to 40 years, received over $30 billion of orders from investors, the sources said. They added the demand was skewed towards the longer-dated bonds.
Meta did not respond to a request for comment.
Among big technology companies, Meta had been the only one that did not have debt on its books. Tapping the market now would help it build a more traditional balance sheet. That could give it more financial room as it tries to fund some expensive initiatives, such as its metaverse virtual reality and Reels short video product, at a time its cash pile is depleting, the sources said.
The sources, who declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Meta started working in earnest on the offering over the last couple of months.
It decided to launch the offering after releasing earnings late July, they said. The varying maturities of its offering would give it more funding options in the future, they added.
A recent resurgence in corporate bond markets over the past month after a rout earlier this year amid uncertainty about interest rates gave Meta a window to tap the market now, the sources said.
Hoping the U.S. Federal Reserve's fight against inflation through aggressive rate increases was starting to have some impact, investors have rushed back into the bond market.
This week has been one of the busiest of the year, with U.S. investment grade companies raising nearly $60 billion in primary bond markets, according to Informa Global Markets data.
Other tech giants such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) also issued bonds earlier this week, raising $5.5 billion and $6 billion, respectively.
Bankers and investors said such issuance windows may be fleeting and rare in the coming months. Credit spreads could widen later this year, increasing funding costs. read more

377,"Turkish lira in free fall after latest rate cut urged by Erdogan
- Summary
- Selloff stoked by Erdogan pressure, premature rate cuts
- Central bank slashes rates again despite 20% inflation
- Week-long meltdown echoes earlier dislocations
ISTANBUL, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Turkey's lira crashed 6% to new all-time lows on Thursday after the central bank, under pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan, forged on with a rate cut seen as dangerous for the big emerging market economy.
The currency hit 11.3 to the dollar in volatile trade and also touched new lows against the euro, its worst day since a full-blown currency crisis in 2018. At 1417 GMT, a dollar bought 11.05 lira.
The lira has lost more than a third of its value in the last eight monthsdue to concerns by both investors and savers over premature monetary easingand inflation soaring to near 20%, both of which have eaten deeply into Turks' earnings.
The central bank's credibility is in tatters after analysts say it has buckled to Erdogan's calls for monetary stimulus, and after the president rapidly overhauled its leadership.
A day after Erdogan pledged to keep battling interest rates ""to the end"", the central bank cut the key rate by another 100 basis points to 15%.

378,"U.S. raises concerns about China aligning with Russia at meeting it calls 'intense'
ROME/WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Monday raised concerns about China's alignment with Russia in a seven-hour meeting with Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi as Washington warned of the isolation and penalties Beijing will face if it helps Moscow in its invasion of Ukraine.
The meeting took place in Rome as Washington told allies in NATO and several Asian countries that China had signaled its willingness to provide military and economic aid to Russia to support its war, two U.S. officials said. read more
The U.S. message, sent in a diplomatic cable, also noted China was expected to deny those plans, said one of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""It's real, it's consequential, and it's really alarming,"" the second U.S. official said, although the U.S. government offered no public evidence to back its assertions of China's willingness to provide such aid to Russia.
After talks ended, the White House issued a short statement, saying Sullivan raised a ""range of issues in U.S.-China relations, with substantial discussion of Russia's war against Ukraine.""
costs, U.S. officials had said Sullivan planned to warn of the isolation China could face globally if it supported Russia.

China and the United States should strengthen dialogue, properly manage differences, and avoid conflict and confrontation, he said.
Ryan Hass of the Brookings Institution said Chinese support for Russia ""would considerably narrow its path for preserving non-hostile relations with the United States and the West"" and not likely alter the trajectory of the conflict.

Opportunities began to present themselves to him, and he finally tapped into and allowed his creative sideshow. Pull Up was published alongside a music video so that people may get to know Arshbro better. He next published Don’t Leave, which stays in the hearts of his most devoted admirers to this day.
Arshbro’s musical style is exceptional in every way. He doesn’t categorize himself in any single genre of music, yet he dabbles in almost everything. The most pleasing fact is how soon he arrived on the scene and made a point of putting himself out there. He strives to get involved in hip-hop, afrobeat, and other scenes.
Arshbro as Owner of a Record Label
After perfecting his skills, he decided to launch his own record label, 211 Records. Because he perceived himself as a brand, he felt that growing that brand would inevitably lead to greater possibilities. He has put in the time and effort to study the ins and outs of producing, mixing, and mastering. So much so that he engineered the majority of the sound for his upcoming release. These are the qualities and talents he believes will catapult his organization to unthinkable prosperity.

NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - A former Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O) product manager and his brother pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to wire fraud charges in what U.S. prosecutors called the first insider trading case involving cryptocurrency.
Ishan Wahi, 32, the former product manager, was arrested last month in Seattle on charges he shared confidential information with his brother Nikhil and their friend Sameer Ramani about forthcoming announcements of new digital assets that Coinbase would allow users to trade.
Nikhil Wahi also pleaded not guilty during an arraignment on Wednesday in Manhattan federal court before U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska. Ramani, who was also charged, is at large.
Prosecutors said Nikhil Wahi and Ramani used ethereum blockchain wallets to acquire the assets and traded at least 14 times before Coinbase announcements in June 2021 and April 2022. The announcements typically caused the assets to rise in value and generated at least $1.5 million in illicit gains, prosecutors said. read more
Coinbase is one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges.
David Miller, a lawyer for Ishan Wahi, said the charges should be dismissed because insider trading needs to involve securities or commodities and this case did not.
Miller also said Coinbase tested new tokens before it publicly listed them, meaning the information his client was accused of sharing was not confidential.
Noah Solowiejczyk, a prosecutor, countered that the information was nonpublic and the prosecution was consistent with previous wire fraud cases.
U.S. regulators are weighing how to oversee cryptocurrency trading.
Coinbase did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month, the company said it had shared with prosecutors its findings from an internal probe into the trading.
Bail for the Wahi brothers was set at $1 million each. Their next court appearance is scheduled for March 22.

NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - Speculators' net long bets on the U.S. dollar edged higher in the latest week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The value of the net long dollar position was $5.44 billion for the week ended March 8. Last week, speculators' net long position stood at $5.12 billion, the lowest level since mid-August 2021.
U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc, and Canadian and Australian dollars.
In a wider measure of dollar positioning that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian rouble, the greenback posted a net long of $3.88 billion, up from $3.84 billion a week earlier.
The fallout from the Russia-Ukraine has boosted the dollar, upending investor expectations for a weaker greenback as geopolitical uncertainty and worries over European growth raise the U.S. currency’s appeal. read more
The dollar which rose 6.3% against a basket of currencies in 2021, has climbed another 3.6% for the year.

Oct 14 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc (C.N), like its Wall Street peers, made the best of a boom in dealmaking to post strong quarterly profit on Thursday, fending off a weakness in its lending business, which the bank's management said would continue to be under pressure.
A sizzling hot stock market and cheap borrowing costs have helped U.S. companies raise billions of dollars in debt and equity and funnel a big share of it into deals, for which they used large investment banks for advice.
The torrid pace of dealmaking boosted investment banking fees to an all-time record in the first nine months of the year, with banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), Citi and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) benefiting the most.
""It was Citi's best M&A quarter and the second best investment banking quarter in a decade,"" Chief Executive Jane Fraser said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts.
The bank's investment banking revenue jumped 39% to $1.9 billion, helping offset a 16% decline in fixed-income revenue from a year earlier when there was unprecedented market volatility.
Its profit got a big boost by the decision to ease $1.16 billion from its loan loss reserves. A year earlier it had added $436 million to the reserves to survive a potential impact from the pandemic.
JPMorgan, Bank of America (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) have also released funds.
SLUGGISH LOAN BOOK
The reserve release along with a surge in deals helped Citi offset declines at its consumer bank due to lower interest income as customers saved up on cash during lockdowns and paid off loans. Net interest revenue declined 1% from a year earlier.
Executives said on Thursday that the bank had struggled to grow its lending business, even though consumer spending picked up during the quarter.
""Healthy consumer balance sheets and persistently elevated payment rates did mean that loan growth remained under pressure,"" CEO Fraser said.
However, the silver lining is that net interest revenue was 2% more than the second quarter, suggesting an end to the downward trend that started when the pandemic began and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero.
Lower rates also hurt Citi's treasury and trade solutions business as revenue decline 4% even as it collected more fees and saw growth in trade loans.

388,"Brazil's Azul backs off from LATAM bid, citing valuation concerns
SAO PAULO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Azul SA confirmed making an offer this month to combine with Chile's LATAM Airlines Group (LTM.SN), which is in bankruptcy proceedings, but the Brazilian airline said it had since decided to focus on its own operations.
LATAM shares plunged on Monday by as much as 85% in Santiago trading, before paring losses to around 45%. read more
Azul shares rose 2.8% in Sao Paulo after saying in a securities filing late on Sunday it would consider potential partnerships only in the future.
The Brazilian airline said its non-binding proposal submitted on Nov. 11 had included around $5 billion in equity financing and was backed by some creditors of LATAM.
However, Azul added that LATAM's valuation in the bankruptcy proceedings had become higher than it found acceptable, citing ongoing uncertainty in the aviation industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in long-haul markets.
LATAM filed a reorganization plan on Friday in which it proposed an $8.19 billion infusion of capital into the group in a bid to exit its Chapter 11 bankruptcy. read more
The Chilean company previously said it had received several offers to fund the exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, each of which was worth more than $5 billion. read more
Azul said in its filing that it believed its non-binding proposal would have provided significant increased network growth and generated synergies estimated at more than $4 billion.
It added that ""the standalone plan presented by LATAM is, by definition, unable to generate synergies from a combination"".
Goldman Sachs analysts warned in a note to clients that any tie-up between the airlines would have held more 60% of Brazil's domestic air travel market, which could have attracted ""extensive"" scrutiny from antitrust regulator CADE.
Azul said it will continue to focus on the competitive advantages of its own network, while evaluating future partnerships and consolidation opportunities.

389,"EXCLUSIVE Governments turn tables on ransomware gang REvil by pushing it offline
Oct 21 (Reuters) - The ransomware group REvil was itself hacked and forced offline this week by a multi-country operation, according to three private sector cyber experts working with the United States and one former official.
Former partners and associates of the Russian-led criminal gang were responsible for a May cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline that led to widespread gas shortages on the U.S. East Coast. REvil's direct victims include top meatpacker JBS (JBSS3.SA). The crime group's ""Happy Blog” website, which had been used to leak victim data and extort companies, is no longer available.
Officials said the Colonial attack used encryption software called DarkSide, which was developed by REvil associates.
VMWare (VMW.N) head of cybersecurity strategy Tom Kellermann said law enforcement and intelligence personnel stopped the group from victimizing additional companies.
""The FBI, in conjunction with Cyber Command, the Secret Service and like-minded countries, have truly engaged in significant disruptive actions against these groups,” said Kellermann, an adviser to the U.S. Secret Service on cybercrime investigations. “REvil was top of the list.”.""
U.S. government attempts to stop REvil, one of the worst of dozens of ransomware gangs that work with hackers to penetrate and paralyze companies around the world, accelerated after the group compromised U.S. software management company Kaseya in July.
That breach opened access to hundreds of Kaseya's customers all at once, leading to numerous emergency cyber incident response calls.

Reliable backups are one of the most important defenses against ransomware attacks, but they must be kept unconnected from the main networks or they too can be encrypted by extortionists such as REvil.
A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the operation specifically.
""Broadly speaking, we are undertaking a whole of government ransomware effort, including disruption of ransomware infrastructure and actors, working with the private sector to modernize our defenses, and building an international coalition to hold countries who harbor ransom actors accountable,"" the person said.
The FBI declined to comment.

392,"Pope apologizes for 'deplorable evil' of Canadian indigenous schools
- Summary
- Pope is on apology tour of Canada
- Condemns past ""colonizing mentality"" of Christians
- Over 150,000 indigenous children were separated from families
- Indigenous people want Vatican museums to return artifacts
MASKWACIS, Alberta, July 25 (Reuters) - Pope Francis apologized on Monday to Canada's native people on their land for the Church's role in schools where indigenous children were abused, calling their forced cultural assimilation a ""deplorable evil"" and ""disastrous error.""
Speaking near the site of two former schools in Maskwacis, Alberta, Francis apologized for Christian support of the ""colonizing mentality"" of the times and called for a ""serious"" investigation of the schools to help survivors and descendants heal.
""With shame and unambiguously, I humbly beg forgiveness for the evil committed by so many Christians against the indigenous peoples,"" said Francis, who arrived and left in a wheelchair due to a fractured knee.
The address to the First Nations, Metis and Inuit people was the first apology on Canadian soil by the pope as a part of tour to heal deep wounds that rose to the fore after the discovery of unmarked graves at residential schools last year.
The 85-year-old pope had promised such a tour to indigenous delegations that visited him earlier this year at the Vatican, where he made an initial apology.
Indigenous leaders wearing eagle-feather war headdresses greeted the pope as a fellow chief and welcomed him with chanting, beating of drums, dancing and war songs.
""I am here because the first step of my penitential pilgrimage among you is that of again asking forgiveness, of telling you once more that I am deeply sorry,"" he said.
He was addressing the indigenous groups in the Bear Park Pow-Wow Grounds, part of the the ancestral territory of the Cree, Dene, Blackfoot, Saulteaux and Nakota Sioux people.
""Sorry for the ways in which, regrettably, many Christians supported the colonizing mentality of the powers that oppressed the indigenous peoples. I am sorry,"" he said. ""In the face of this deplorable evil, the Church kneels before God and implores his forgiveness for the sins of her children.""

The address to the First Nations, Metis and Inuit people was the first apology on Canadian soil by the pope as a part of tour to heal deep wounds that rose to the fore after the discovery of unmarked graves at residential schools last year.
The 85-year-old pope had promised such a tour to indigenous delegations that visited him earlier this year at the Vatican, where he made an initial apology.
Indigenous leaders wearing eagle-feather war headdresses greeted the pope as a fellow chief and welcomed him with chanting, beating of drums, dancing and war songs.
""I am here because the first step of my penitential pilgrimage among you is that of again asking forgiveness, of telling you once more that I am deeply sorry,"" he said.
He was addressing the indigenous groups in the Bear Park Pow-Wow Grounds, part of the the ancestral territory of the Cree, Dene, Blackfoot, Saulteaux and Nakota Sioux people.
""Sorry for the ways in which, regrettably, many Christians supported the colonizing mentality of the powers that oppressed the indigenous peoples. I am sorry,"" he said. ""In the face of this deplorable evil, the Church kneels before God and implores his forgiveness for the sins of her children.""
After the pope spoke, Chief Wilton Littlechild placed a feather headdress on the pontiff's head. "

GLASGOW, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The Bank of England will announce in the coming days more about how it will align its corporate bond holdings with its goal for companies to fight climate change, Governor Andrew Bailey said on Wednesday.
“Our approach will use our role as an investor for monetary policy purposes to incentivise firms to take meaningful actions in support of climate transition,” Bailey said in a speech at the COP26 climate summit.
“It will therefore take an important step for central banks in focusing on the impact of the financial system on climate change, as well as vice versa,” he added.

OAKLAND, Calif., March 24 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Thursday told appellate judges that video game maker Epic Games had failed to show any legal error that would justify them overturning a lower-court ruling that found key App Store policies do not break U.S. antitrust law.
Epic, known for its ""Fortnite"" game, largely lost a trial last year over whether Apple's payment rules for apps were anticompetitive. That decision found Apple had suitable reasons to force some app makers such as Epic to use its payment system and take commissions of 15% to 30% on their sales.
Following the ruling, Epic appealed in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Apple in its reply on Thursday said Epic had failed to propose a reasonable alternative to the App Store policies.
""Epic asks the Judiciary to fundamentally change the App Store by forcing Apple to abandon the integrated distribution and digital-content delivery model that, among many other procompetitive benefits, helps safeguard user security and privacy,"" the court filing said.
Both Apple and Epic are scheduled to file a second round of arguments before the appeals panel calls a hearing, for possibly next year.

396,"Macron, in Cameroon, says food is Russian weapon of war
French President Emmanuel Macron is welcomed by Cameroon's Prime Minister Joseph Dion Ngute on his arrival in Yaounde, Cameroon July 25, 2022. REUTERS/Desire Danga Essigue.
YAOUNDE, July 26 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron described the global food crisis as one of Russia's ""weapons of war"" during a visit to Cameroon on Tuesday, dismissing suggestions Western sanctions were to blame.
Cameroon, like many developing countries, is grappling with sharp increases in prices for oil, fertiliser and foodstuffs. Severe fuel shortages hit the capital Yaounde last week leading to long queues at petrol stations.
Macron is on a three-leg tour of Africa, a trip meant to strengthen political ties with the continent and help boost agricultural production amid the growing food insecurity linked to the war in Ukraine.
African governments have largely avoided taking sides and refused to join Western condemnation and sanctions.
At the same time, anti-French sentiment is rising in France's former West African colonies, where security concerns following a string of coups are stoking frustration and swinging public opinion in favour of Russia.
""We are blamed by some who say that European sanctions (on Russia) is the cause of the world food crisis, including in Africa. It is totally false,"" Macron said during a meeting with the French community in Cameroon.
""Food, like energy have become Russian weapons of war ... We must help the African continent to produce more for itself,"" Macron said.
Many African nations are dependent on Russian grain and energy, but they also buy Ukrainian grain that has been disrupted by the conflict.
Moscow denies responsibility for the food crisis, blaming Western sanctions for slowing its food and fertiliser exports and Ukraine for mining the approaches to its ports.
Cameroon, a mineral-rich central African nation, is a major food producer for the region and Macron's delegation will seek investment opportunities in the agricultural sector through a Food and Agriculture Resilience Mission initiative launched in March with the African Union to boost food production.
Macron's met 89-year-old President Paul Biya who has ruled Cameroon for nearly 40 years. The meeting comes after a period of strained relations following Macron's comments in 2020 that he will put ""maximum pressure on Paul Biya"" to put an end to human rights violations in the country.
The government denied the allegations at the time.
Asked during their news conference if he planned to seek another term in 2025, Biya said his decision to ""seek another or return to his village"" would be known at the end of this term.

397,"Long bets on China's yuan at 6-month high; bears pounce on Indian rupee
- Summary
- Bearish bets on India's rupee at highest in 20 months
- Thai baht, Philippine peso, S.Korean won short bets ease
- Yuan up 2.5% so far in 2021; rupee set for 4th annual loss
Dec 16 (Reuters) - Bullish bets on the Chinese yuan hit their highest since early June as the world's second-largest economy maintained a strong trade surplus and saw robust portfolio inflows even as growth slowed, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
Short positions on the Indian rupee were raised to their highest since April 2020, while bearish bets on the Singapore dollar , Indonesia's rupiah and the Malaysian ringgit also increased, a fortnightly poll of 10 respondents showed.
Fears that the Omicron variant would again impede economic activity and travel have left some investors holding out for more information, even as some governments rush to vaccinate those left out, and get boosters administered to the rest.
The yuan has gained 2.5% so far this year, the most among emerging market peers in Asia, as robust export demand helps the country keep its trade surplus robust, and investors maintain high exposure to Chinese assets.
Inflows into China's bond market rose sharply in November, supported by the inclusion of government debt in the FTSE World Government Bond index, while equity markets saw net inflows compared to heavy outflows over the June-August period, data compiled by ANZ showed.
Analysts at ANZ said they expect the Chinese central bank ""to be tolerant of yuan strength, though they will act to curb excessive volatility in either direction"".
Another consideration on the minds of investors is how quickly the U.S. Federal Reserve will wind down its pandemic-era bond buying and raise rates. Late Wednesday after the poll closed, the Fed said its bond-buying programme would end by March, followed by three possible rate hikes in 2022. read more
The Indian rupee is set for a more than 4% drop this year, its fourth straight annual loss, with losses accelerating towards the end of the year as the country's red-hot equity markets start to cool and trade deficit balloons.
India's economic rebound faces further risks from the Omicron variant, inflation and global supply-chain disruptions, with the central bank leaving its key lending rate at a record low last week while outlining plans to drain surplus liquidity from the banking system.
Short bets on the baht , the worst performer among Asia's emerging markets with a more than 10% slump in value, eased as Thailand re-opened its borders to foreign visitors, which should support the country's tourism-reliant economy.

MUMBAI, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The Indian rupee slipped against the U.S. currency on Friday as the dollar got a boost from U.S. labour data and hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials.
The rupee was trading at 79.7350 per U.S. dollar by 0436 GMT, down from 79.6725 in the previous session. It opened at 79.7575 and since then has traded in an about 4 paisa trading range.
It is ""not entirely unexpected"" that after a higher opening move, there is ""not much follow through"", a trader at a Mumbai-based bank said.
""Thanks to RBI, there will be hesitancy to buy dollar near to 80.""
The Reserve Bank of India has been regularly stepping in to manage the rupee's volatility. The local currency last month reached a record low of 80.0650. According to RBI's monthly bulletin, released On Thursday, the central bank sold a net $3.7 billion in June.
The dollar index rose 0.2% on Friday to 107.72, adding to the previous session's advance read more . Asian currencies were broadly weaker, notably the Chinese yuan. The offshore yuan fell to 6.8290 to the dollar, the lowest level in three months.
Data out on Thursday showed an unexpected dip in U.S. jobless claims, signalling that the labour market was holding up well to the rise in interest rates and that the Fed could keep hiking borrowing cost aggressively.
Meanwhile, comments by Fed officials continued to emphasise the need for more rate hikes. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said that given the strength of the economy he is currently leaning toward supporting a third straight 75-basis-point interest rate hike in September.

- Summary
- Nine people arrested after pre-dawn raid given bail
- Prime minister, new cabinet sworn in
- Wickremesinghe set to keep finance portfolio
- UN says crackdown could worsen instability
COLOMBO, July 22 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan security forces raided and partially cleared a protest camp occupying government grounds in Colombo early on Friday, fuelling fears that President Ranil Wickremesinghe had launched a crackdown a day after being sworn in.
Media footage showed soldiers in riot gear and armed with assault rifles tearing down the camp, set up in April by protesters enraged by the country's economic collapse and acute shortages of fuel, food and medicine.
Wickremesinghe, a six-time prime minister, was sworn in as president on Thursday after winning a parliamentary vote to succeed Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who fled to Singapore last week in the wake of massive public protests triggered by Sri Lanka's worst economic crisis in seven decades. read more
""A joint operation involving the military, police and police special forces was launched in the early hours to recover the presidential secretariat from the protesters as they have no legal right to hold it,"" police spokesperson Nalin Thalduwa told Reuters.
Nine people arrested in the pre-dawn raid were later granted bail by a Colombo court, police said.
Protesters had feared a crackdown afterWickremesinghe as acting head of state on Monday imposed a national state of emergency. Many regard him as an ally of Rajapaksa.
Previous emergency regulations have been used to give powers to the military to arrest protesters and curtail the right to demonstrate.
CALLS FOR RESTRAINT
A representative of the United Nations and Western envoys urged the government to exercise restraint, saying the use of force could further destabilise the island nation, whose economy desperately needs an International Monetary Fund bailout, having virtually run out of dollars to pay for vital imports. read more
The United States' ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung, said she had met the new president to express ""grave concern"" over the violence against protesters in Colombo on Friday.
""This is not the time to crack down on citizens, but instead to look ahead at the immediate and tangible steps the Government can take to regain the trust of the people, restore stability, and rebuild the economy,"" Chung said in a tweet.

Wickremesinghe, a six-time prime minister, was sworn in as president on Thursday after winning a parliamentary vote to succeed Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who fled to Singapore last week in the wake of massive public protests triggered by Sri Lanka's worst economic crisis in seven decades. read more
""A joint operation involving the military, police and police special forces was launched in the early hours to recover the presidential secretariat from the protesters as they have no legal right to hold it,"" police spokesperson Nalin Thalduwa told Reuters.
Nine people arrested in the pre-dawn raid were later granted bail by a Colombo court, police said.
Protesters had feared a crackdown afterWickremesinghe as acting head of state on Monday imposed a national state of emergency. Many regard him as an ally of Rajapaksa.
Previous emergency regulations have been used to give powers to the military to arrest protesters and curtail the right to demonstrate.
CALLS FOR RESTRAINT
A representative of the United Nations and Western envoys urged the government to exercise restraint, saying the use of force could further destabilise the island nation, whose economy desperately needs an International Monetary Fund bailout, having virtually run out of dollars to pay for vital imports. read more
The United States' ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung, said she had met the new president to express ""grave concern"" over the violence against protesters in Colombo on Friday.
""This is not the time to crack down on citizens, but instead to look ahead at the immediate and tangible steps the Government can take to regain the trust of the people, restore stability, and rebuild the economy,"" Chung said in a tweet.

* Many traders have already halted Russian diesel trading

LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - Russian diesel is trading at a steep discount to the fuel produced by other countries, traders said, creating a potentially lucrative two-tier market window for some ahead of a possible EU oil embargo on Moscow.

409,"Cheney: Jan. 6 panel could make multiple criminal referrals of Trump
July 3 (Reuters) - The congressional panel investigating last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol by Donald Trump's supporters could make multiple referrals to the Justice Department seeking criminal charges against the former president, its vice chair Liz Cheney said.
Cheney, in an interview aired on Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" program, also said the department does not need to wait for the House of Representatives select committee to make a formal recommendation of charges to take action against Trump.
Asked whether the committee's hearings have demonstrated that Trump needs to be prosecuted, Cheney said, ""Ultimately, the Justice Department will decide that.""
Cheney, one of two Republicans on the Democratic-led panel, said that ""we'll make a decision as a committee"" about whether to make a formal criminal referral to the Justice Department recommending charges against Trump.
""The Justice Department doesn't have to wait for the committee to make a criminal referral. There could be more than one criminal referral,"" Cheney said.
Criminal charges have never been brought against a sitting or former U.S. president. Asked what it would mean for the country if President Joe Biden's Justice Department brings charges against his predecessor, Cheney said, ""I have greater concern about what it would mean if people weren't held accountable for what's happened here.""
Cheney has criticized Trump's conduct before, during and after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters in their failed bid to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's 2020 election victory, including an incendiary speech immediately preceding the riot.
,"" Cheney said.
added.
Cheney, whose father Dick Cheney served as vice president from 2001 to 2009, also said she has not yet decided on a possible run for the presidency in 2024 even as she faces a Republican primary challenge in her re-election bid this year for her House seat representing Wyoming.
Trump has not yet announced whether he will seek the presidency again in 2024.
""A man as dangerous as Donald Trump can absolutely never be anywhere near the Oval Office ever again,"" Cheney said.
A representative for Trump did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment.
Trump has denied responsibility for the Capitol attack but has said he would pardon those involved if he again becomes president.
Cassidy Hutchinson, a former top aide to Trump's then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, delivered bombshell testimony to the panel last week about Trump's conduct on the day of the riot.
Hutchinson testified that Trump tried to grab the steering wheel of his presidential limousine when his security detail declined to take him to the Capitol to join his supporters.

SYDNEY, March 7 (Reuters) - China must act on its declarations of promoting world peace and join the effort to stop Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Australia's prime minister said on Monday, warning that the world was in danger of being reshaped by an ""arc of autocracy"".
Scott Morrison also suggested in a wide-ranging speech that Russia's invasion was not going according to the plan of its leader, Vladimir Putin, who he said had ""overestimated the capacity of how he might be able to prosecute this illegal war"".
""China has long claimed to have a role as one of the major powers in the world and to be a contributor to global peace and stability.

Morrison called it a ""gross violation of international law"" and ""the latest example of an authoritarian regime seeking to challenge the status quo through threats and violence"".

415,"(Updates prices, changes dateline; previous LONDON)
NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose on Monday to its highest level in more than three years as investors awaited key inflation data later this week to determine how hawkish the Federal Reserve will need to be on its policy path.
Markets are bracing for Tuesday’s consumer price index (CPI) reading for March, with expectations for a year-over-year increase of 8.4%, according to Reuters estimates. February’s data showing a 7.9% increase was the largest annual reading in 40 years. On Wednesday, the producer price index (PPI) will be announced.
“The risk would be on the downside in that there is an indication that maybe inflation might have peaked, that would get a little bit of a reaction from the market,” said Jim Barnes, director of fixed income at Bryn Mawr Trust in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.
“I don’t think it changes the overall tone but it does put the brakes on.”
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 3.8 basis points to 2.753% after climbing to 2.784%, its highest level since January 2019. The yield was on track to climb for a seventh straight session.
With ultra-hot inflation likely forcing the Fed’s hand to raise rates, likely slowing the economy and possibly inducing a recession, riskier assets have been under pressure this year as yields rise. The S&P 500 is down more than 6% this year and growth stocks, which are more likely to see earnings suffer in a rising rate environment, are down more than 12% for the year.
Fed policymakers have repeatedly commented on the need for the central bank to be more aggressive in taking steps to combat high inflation, including raising rates. On Sunday, Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester said inflation will remain high this year and next even as the Fed moves steadily to lower the pace of price increases.
The central bank rose rates by 25 basis points at its March meeting, its first hike since 2018, and expectations for a 50 basis point hike at its May meeting stand at 82.1%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool here.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was up 5.1 basis points to 2.797% after touching 2.803%, its highest since May 2019.
A closely watched part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve measuring the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, seen as an indicator of economic expectations, was at 22.9 basis points. The spread has begun to steepen again after briefly inverting at the end of March, which is seen by many as a reliable recession indicator.
The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 0.2 basis points at 2.522%.

NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose on Monday to its highest level in more than three years as investors awaited key inflation data later this week to determine how hawkish the Federal Reserve will need to be on its policy path.

- High vaccination rate should keep factories open
- Nine months ago, lockdowns hit global brands
- Vietnam is a key exporter of clothing, electronics

HANOI, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Vietnamese factories making everything from shoes to smartphones are expected to continue production despite record COVID-19 infections, reversing a policy of sweeping lockdowns last year that hobbled global supply chains for Western retailers.
One of the world's biggest garment makers, Vietnam reported more than 26,000 new infections on Sunday, or about double the peak last year, when factories supplying brands such as Nike , Zara, Apple (AAPL.O) and Samsung (005930.KS) were shut for months.
But unlike nine months ago, when the Delta variant was spreading through a mostly unvaccinated population, now millions of factory workers have been fully vaccinated and the Omicron variant is proving less severe, the government said.

WASHINGTON, July 11 (Reuters) - A man whose son was killed in the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, interrupted President Joe Biden's remarks at the White House on Monday during an event to herald the passage of the first major federal gun safety law in three decades.
Manuel Oliver, whose son Joaquin was murdered in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre, shouted ""we've already gone through this for years and years"" at the event, during which Biden lauded the new law but said more needed to be done.
""Sit down and you'll hear what I have to say,"" Biden said from the lectern on the White House South Lawn before urging Oliver be allowed to speak. Oliver was escorted away from his seat and Biden continued with his address.
The incident underscored the difficulty Biden, a Democrat, has had in addressing the problem of gun violence. Advocates for stronger gun safety laws see him as an ally but want him to do more to stop the stream of gun-related deaths that have become a part of daily life in the United States.

429,"German economy minister rules out keeping nuclear plants running to save gas
- Summary
- Economy minister says nuclear plants save minimal gas
- May have to keep plant running in Bavaria for network stability
- Scholz says nuclear plant stress test results due within weeks
BERLIN, Aug 21 (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Robert Habeck ruled out on Sunday extending the lifespan of the country's three remaining nuclear power plants in order to save gas, saying it would save at most 2 percent of gas use.
These savings were not sufficient to be worth reopening the debate about the exit from nuclear energy given the consensus on the topic, he said during a discussion with citizens at the government's open-door day.
Former Chancellor Angela Merkel initiated legislation to halt the use of nuclear power by the end of this year after the Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011 with a majority of voters in favour. But attitudes are shifting amid fears of an energy crisis this winter following a decline in Russian gas deliveries - with the three-way coalition itself divided on the matter. read more
""It is the wrong decision given the little we would save,"" said Habeck, a member of the Greens party, which has it roots in the anti-nuclear movement of the 1970s and 80s.
On the other side of the debate, Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats reiterated his stance that it would be better to extend the lifespans of nuclear plants for a limited time than to bring coal plants back online.
""We shouldn't be too picky, but reserve all possibilities,"" he said, adding that he would be open to an extension of ""several years"" in the current circumstances.
Separately to the debate over gas savings measures, Habeck said he was open to extending the lifespan of one nuclear power plant in Bavaria if a stress test showed this was necessary to ensure the stability and supply of the electricity network in winter, he said.
Habeck accused the southern state and manufacturing hub, which depends on gas-fired power plants and has few coal-fired plants, of possibly contributing to problems by failing build up wind power production and improve the network.
The fact that Germany is having to supply France with electricity due to a drop in nuclear output is another factor at play.

NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. crude exports are ramping up due to increasing demand from Asia and Europe and recovering U.S. production from the lows of the coronavirus pandemic.
Surging worldwide demand, supply outages and international political tension have stoked worries around crude supplies, boosting oil prices to the highest levels in seven years, with some predicting crude could even reach $100 per barrel. That has brought in more buyers of U.S. oil, increasing exports and decreasing domestic crude stockpiles. read more

435,"According to recent news reports, flight prices have reached a record high – 33.3% above last year’s highs. This is the largest increase in one year and coincides with the summer travel season, when demand for air travel is typically the highest. While higher jet fuel costs are a contributing factor, understanding has also contributed to higher prices. Meanwhile, airlines have cut summer schedules to deal with this rising demand.
The demand for travel is “strongest” it has seen in 30 years
Booking sites in the U.S. have seen a spike in demand for both spring and summer travel. As the country emerges from a COVID-19 pandemic, consumers appear to be ready to fly. Airlines like Delta Air Lines are reporting their highest booking volumes ever. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has said travel demand is the “strongest” it has been in over 30 years.
The increase in international travel is driving demand for airfares. American Airlines reported that travel across the Atlantic and to South America was up 60 percent in March, with premium seats making up for a decline in international corporate travel. Meanwhile, travel to Asia is still lagging due to health restrictions. However, the airline industry is optimistic about 2022. Expedia’s analysts are projecting that demand for summer travel will hit “strongest” levels in 30 years.
Higher jet fuel costs are to blame
As the holiday travel season draws closer, the airline industry has been preparing for a spike in flight prices. The reason for the hike is not entirely clear. It’s likely that the higher fuel costs will be passed along to passengers. Higher jet fuel costs tend to increase with higher demand. And because jet fuel costs are made from oil, any increase will likely be passed on to passengers. That means record-high flight prices for everyone.
The oil rally is taking jet fuel with it. The Russian invasion, for example, has impacted oil prices, which are largely a reflection of rising demand. In addition, the arctic blast that hit the U.S. has disrupted oil production, refining, and transportation. Millions of Texans were left without heat, which is especially problematic for airlines that rely heavily on natural gas.
Understaffing is a factor
A lack of staff is a factor in flight prices, which have reached unprecedented heights over the past year. Many airlines have been dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, pilot shortages, and regular service interruptions. A recent survey found that flight prices rose 33.3% year-over-year in April, the highest increase since December 1980. This increase coincides with high inflation and peak travel season in the US. And if you’re traveling this summer, these price increases could prove to be costly.
In a recent survey, over half of U.S. travelers expected higher airfares in the next six months. The shortage has led airlines to scramble to adjust their summer schedules. Despite this shortage, Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have added flights to popular summer destinations to make up for the shortfall. In the meantime, some airlines have been forced to cut flights, which has pushed up airfares.
Airlines are reducing summer schedules
As flight prices rise, airlines are adjusting their summer schedules to accommodate the increased demand. Some airlines have cut flights by as much as 16%, but others are increasing hiring plans. While consumer spending remains strong, airlines are adjusting to labor shortages and supply chain issues.

439,"Nearly 12 months to the day Bill Cosby was set free from government jail on a detail, the sequential sexual stalker is presently back in court for one more claimed rape — this time, of a high school young lady.
Today, jury determination started at Los Angeles Superior Court for a common suit brought down against the shamed entertainer and humorist. Judy Huth claims she was grabbed by Cosby when she was a youngster after he carried her and a companion to the Playboy manor during the 1970’s.
In a grievance Huth recorded in December 2014, she says she was only 15 when she and a companion, who was 16, initially met Cosby while he was in Los Angeles shooting a film. As indicated by the objection, Cosby asked the young ladies how old they were during that gathering. Days after the fact, he welcomed them to his social club where he gave them liquor and later, to the Playboy house — a spot he regularly visited for a really long time. Cosby supposedly taught them to say they were 19, would it be advisable for anyone anybody inquire. Subsequent to showing up at the chateau, Huth claims Cosby physically attacked her, “putting his give over her jeans, and afterward intertwining her hand with his hand and playing out a sex follow up on himself without assent.” Cosby’s lawyers have denied the charges.
There’s been some disarray regarding the specific year Huth claims the attack occurred. In beginning filings, she remembered that it occurred in 1974, yet in later court papers, she reasoned that the supposed attack really happened in 1975, when she was 16 and he was 37. Normally, Cosby’s legitimate group is endeavoring to gain by the revision, pointing out Huth’s “irregularities” and it was underage to reject that she.
“It’s absurd,” his legal advisor Jennifer Bonjean, who’s likewise addressing R. Kelly in his kid porn preliminary, as of late said. “It’s called preliminary by snare.”
His representative, Andrew Wyatt, has added: “We feel certain that the Playboy records alongside Ms. Huth changing her timetable of occasions from 1974 to 1975 in the last minute will justify Mr. Cosby.”

440,"Airplanes were redirected on Friday to avoid icy roads after a snowstorm hit the northeast. The National Weather Service announced that more than 2,000 flights are canceled nationwide and another 4,158 are halted globally. The latest wave of flight cancellations comes just a day after major disruptions occurred over Christmas with a rising number of staff infected with the COVID-19 virus.
The last time the United States experienced a bomb cyclone was in October when rains caused flash flooding and mudslides. About 117,000 people lost power in California, and this latest blizzard has affected many of the same airports. In fact, the blizzard has displaced nearly 40,000 people from their homes and businesses, affecting the travel industry in the process.
Forecasters have warned that the storm, known as a bomb cyclone, is set to affect the east coast throughout the night. In fact, it has already impacted Charlotte Douglas International Airport, one of the busiest airports in the country. More than 1,100 flights from Charlotte Douglas International Airport have been canceled, while 90 flights from Philadelphia and New York have been canceled altogether. American Airlines is urging travelers to rebook a flight.
In addition to cancellations, more than 2,000 flights are canceled on Sunday due to the winter storm hitting the East Coast. A majority of American Airlines flights out of Charlotte Douglas International Airport have been canceled, with more than 1,000 canceled for Sunday. As the winter storm hits the east coast, airport operations will be disrupted and passengers may be forced to wait for days before reaching their destination.
As of Sunday evening, more than 2,000 flights are canceled for Sunday as a winter storm strikes the East Coast.

Guzman was set to travel to France this week for formal talks with the group of lenders over restructuring some $2 billion in debt.

- Summary
- ECB to up rates by 25 or 50 bps in 1st hike since 2011
- New bond-buying tool subject to Commission's rules
FRANKFURT, July 19 (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers are considering raising interest rates by a bigger-than-expected 50 basis points at their meeting on Thursday to tame record-high inflation, two sources with direct knowledge of the discussion told Reuters.
To cushion the impact of the higher borrowing costs, policymakers are also expected to announce a deal to help indebted countries like Italy on the bond market. The deal will require they stick to European Commission rules on reforms and budget discipline, the sources said.
The ECB is set to deliver its first rate hike in more than a decade on Thursday against a difficult economic backdrop exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. Inflation is high and rising while economic growth has slowed and a political crisis in Italy is keeping investors on edge.
That dynamic creates a balancing act for the ECB, between raising rates to curb price growth and ensuring that the most indebted of the euro zone's 19 member countries don't run into financial trouble as a result.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deliberations are private, said the discussion about whether to increase rates by 25 or 50 basis points was still wide open.
Other major central banks have been raising rates in bigger increments, such as 75 or even 100 basis points, raising the pressure on the ECB to do more.
But the risk of a recession in the euro zone, particularly if Russia turns off the taps to natural gas supplies, made some ECB governors more cautious about choking growth, the sources said.
An ECB spokesperson declined to comment, citing the bank's pre-meeting quiet period.
The euro jumped on Tuesday after Reuters first reported that a 50 bp hike was under discussion, and was last up 0.9% against the dollar at $1.0232. The single currency briefly fell below parity last week.
Yields on euro zone government bonds also rose, with Germany's two-year benchmark now yielding 1.329%.

447,"Analysis: Drug pricing reform opponents win most pharma lobbying money
Oct 25 (Reuters) - Democratic Party lawmakers holding up proposed drug pricing reforms are among the largest beneficiaries of the pharmaceutical industry's push to stave off price cuts, a Reuters analysis of public lobbying and campaign data shows.
The industry, which traditionally gives more to Republicans, channeled around 60% of donated campaign funds to Democrats this year. It has spent over $177 million on lobbying and campaign donations in 2021.
Nonprofit political action committees (PACs) run by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) were among the biggest donors, according to political spending data from OpenSecrets, formerly the Center for Responsive Politics.
Drugmakers are seeking to block laws that would give the U.S. government authority to negotiate prices for prescription medicines. Current U.S. law bars the government's Medicare health insurance program from negotiating drug prices directly.
Many of the Democrats opposing an ambitious drug reduction bill proposed in the House of Representatives are among some of the biggest recipients of drug manufacturer lobbying funds.
They include Senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and Representative Scott Peters of California, OpenSecrets data covering industry donations through September of 2021 shows. In all, they have received around $1 million in pharmaceutical and health product industry donations this year.
A spokesperson for Sinema did not respond to a request for comment on the funds she has received but said the Senator supports making drugs as cheap as possible for patients.
Menendez and Peters said the donations did not influence their views. All three said they are opposed to The Lower Drug Costs Now Act, which is sponsored by Democrats in the House of Representatives and also known as H.R.3.
Menendez and Peters have advocated for alternative scaled-back drug pricing reforms that would still allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices but would lead to significantly smaller savings.
Congressman Frank Pallone of New Jersey, who is also one of the top recipients of drugmaker donations, voted in favor of H.R.3.
Sinema, who campaigned in 2018 on cutting drug prices, told the White House she opposes allowing Medicare to negotiate them.

Drugmakers are seeking to block laws that would give the U.S. government authority to negotiate prices for prescription medicines. Current U.S. law bars the government's Medicare health insurance program from negotiating drug prices directly.
Many of the Democrats opposing an ambitious drug reduction bill proposed in the House of Representatives are among some of the biggest recipients of drug manufacturer lobbying funds.
They include Senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and Representative Scott Peters of California, OpenSecrets data covering industry donations through September of 2021 shows. In all, they have received around $1 million in pharmaceutical and health product industry donations this year.
A spokesperson for Sinema did not respond to a request for comment on the funds she has received but said the Senator supports making drugs as cheap as possible for patients.
Menendez and Peters said the donations did not influence their views. All three said they are opposed to The Lower Drug Costs Now Act, which is sponsored by Democrats in the House of Representatives and also known as H.R.3.
Menendez and Peters have advocated for alternative scaled-back drug pricing reforms that would still allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices but would lead to significantly smaller savings.
Congressman Frank Pallone of New Jersey, who is also one of the top recipients of drugmaker donations, voted in favor of H.R.3.
Sinema, who campaigned in 2018 on cutting drug prices, told the White House she opposes allowing Medicare to negotiate them. "

460,"Cryptoverse: Shrimps and whales keep bitcoin afloat
July 12 (Reuters) - The shrimps of the crypto world have joined the whales in a glorious last stand to banish the bleak bitcoin winter.
These two contrasting groups are both HODLers - investors in bitcoin as a long-term proposition who refuse to sell their holdings - and they are determined to drive back the bears, despite their portfolios being deep in the red.
Shrimps, investors that hold less than 1 bitcoin, are collectively adding to their balance at a rate of 60,460 bitcoin per month, the most aggressive rate in history, according to an analysis by data firm Glassnode.
Whales, those with more than 1,000 bitcoin, were adding 140,000 coins per month, the highest rate since January 2021.
""The market is approaching a HODLer-led regime,"" Glassnode said in a note, referring to the cohort whose name emerged years ago from a trader misspelling ""hold"" on an online forum.
After bitcoin's worst month in 11 years in June, the decline appears to have abated as transaction demand seemed to be moving sideways, according to Glassnode, indicating a stagnation of new entrants and a probable retention of a base-load of users, ie HODLers.

461,"U.S. Senate Democrats unveil Russia sanctions bill to bolster Ukraine

WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats on Wednesday unveiled a bill to impose sweeping sanctions on top Russian government and military officials, including President Vladimir Putin, and key banking institutions if Moscow engages in hostilities against Ukraine.
The proposed legislation, backed by the White House, includes provisions to help bolster Ukraine’s security and encourages the United States to ""consider all available and appropriate measures"" to ensure the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline - a ""tool of malign influence of the Russian Federation"" - does not become operational.
""This legislation makes it absolutely clear that the U.S. Senate will not stand idly by as the Kremlin threatens a re-invasion of Ukraine,"" Senator Robert Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who unveiled the bill, said in a statement.
Russia has amassed about 100,000 troops on Ukraine's border and Washington is trying to dissuade Moscow from re-invading the country.
The bill, first reported by the Washington Post, would also target companies in Russia that offer secure messaging systems, such as SWIFT, which banks use to exchange key information with other financial institutions.
More than two dozen Democrats, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have endorsed the bill, a Menendez spokesperson said.
The bill would ""trigger severe costs to Russia's economy"" if Russia goes ahead with an invasion, a spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council said.
Other legislation, such as a billsponsored by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, will ""not counter further Russian aggression or protect Ukraine,"" the NSC spokesperson said.
Cruz struck a deal with Schumer last month, in which the Texas senator released his hold on dozens of President Joe Biden's ambassadorial nominees. Cruz's bill will be put to a vote this week, but it requires 60 votes to pass, a high hurdle in the evenly divided Senate.
The Menendez-backed bill provides an alternative for Democrats who support sanctions on the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is completed but waiting approvals from Germany, and makes it harder for Cruz's bill to pass.
Many Democrats have supported sanctions on the pipeline as it would bypass Ukraine, depriving the country of transit fees and potentially undermining its struggle against Russia.

'STRONG HANDS'
Many cryptocurrency experts caution that no one has been known to reliably predict bitcoin's characteristically wild price swings. In 2017, for example, it went from about $1,000 to around $20,000. In early 2020, it sunk below $4,000 at one point before beginning a dizzying rise.
Yet advocates of bitcoin and other coins say the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance and investing in recent years has shored up the sector.
Cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital said their research showed a similar shift towards bitcoin being held for longer period by investors, which it said ""illustrates a transference from shorter-term 'weak hands' to long-term 'strong hands'.""
Crypto data platform Coinglass's bitcoin Fear & Greed index, has wavered between 10 and 29 since the start of the year, which could be an indicator of a possible market bottom and buying opportunities, according to Will Hamilton, head of trading & research at Trovio Capital Management.

- Law firms
(Reuters) - An employee who was told she might be laid off can sue for discrimination even if the layoff did not ultimately happen, a federal appeals court ruled Friday, in an age and disability discrimination lawsuit brought by a former AT&T Inc employee.

European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium June 17, 2022. REUTERS/Yves Herman
LUXEMBOURG, June 28 (Reuters) - Germany can support a European Union proposal to effectively ban new fossil fuel car sales from 2035, if an option is added to allow sales of cars running on ""CO2 neutral"" fuels, German environment minister Steffi Lemke said on Tuesday.
""This addition is important to Germany in terms of our position, we believe it can also be a bridge for the overall discussion,"" Lemke, of Germany's Greens, told a meeting of EU environment ministers, who are trying to come to agreement over the law on Tuesday.
Germany's proposed addition to the law would ask Brussels to make a separate proposal allowing vehicles ""running exclusively on CO2-neutral fuels"" to be sold after 2035, she said.
In its bid to cut planet-warming emissions by 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels, the European Commission has proposed a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions from new cars by 2035. That means not selling combustion-engine cars from then onwards.
Lemke's proposed addition incorporates a demand from German Finance Minister Christian Lindner, who said Lemke's statements earlier Tuesday that showed support for the EU proposal without the tweak were not in line with current agreements.
Lindner, of the pro-business Free Democrats, added that ministries led by his party had not yet agreed on how the German government would vote on the matter.

477,"In rare move, U.S. judge rejects plea agreement by Ahmaud Arbery's murderers
A woman holds a sign
Jan 31 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge in Georgia rejected plea agreements reached between federal prosecutors and two of the three white men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery, saying she was not willing to be bound to the 30-year federal prison sentence set in the agreement.
The unusual decision by U.S. District Judge Lisa Wood came after Travis McMichael, one of the three attackers due to face trial next week on federal hate-crime charges, admitted for the first time he had pursued the 25-year-old Black man because of his race.
The decision means the parties must either return to court with a more acceptable deal when the hearing resumes on Friday morning or prepare next week for trial.
McMichael had appeared in the U.S. District Court in Brunswick, Georgia, in an attempt to change his plea to guilty, admitting to a charge of using a gun in his attempt to apprehend Arbery because of his ""race and color,"" resulting in Arbery's death. He fired at Arbery three times at close range with his shotgun.
His father, Gregory McMichael, had also been due to change his plea to guilty as part of an agreement at a subsequent hearing on Monday over the objections of Arbery's relatives, who successfully begged Wood not to accept the deals.
The McMichaels have already faced trial at the state level when they were convicted of murder last November in a court in Brunswick alongside their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan and sentenced to life in prison. The state judge ruled that only Bryan would ever be able to seek parole.
State prosecutors said the men ""assumed the worst"" about the Black man running through their neighborhood, unfairly thinking he must have been fleeing some crime when they chased him down in pickup trucks before cornering and shooting him in February 2020.
MOTHER'S APPEAL TO JUDGE
In rejecting the federal agreement, Wood acknowledged emotional testimony on Monday by Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, and other relatives who begged the judge not to accept the deal.
They said they were alarmed that prosecutors had agreed to recommend McMichael be transferred to a federal prison for 30 years before returning him to the custody of the Georgia prison system for the rest of his life. Federal prisons are generally perceived as less brutal environments than typical state prisons.
""Granting these men their preferred conditions of confinement will defeat me. It gives them one last chance to spit in my face after murdering my son,"" Cooper-Jones told the court. ""The state of Georgia already gave these men exactly what they deserve. Please leave it that way.""
Assistant U.S. Attorney Tara Lyons said the government had repeatedly consulted with Arbery's family, and that they had previously not opposed an agreement as the best way to ensure that the McMichaels would admit race played a role in their crimes and give up their right to appeal a federal conviction.
""I understand the anger, the pain and the struggle that the family is feeling with this resolution,"" she said in asking the judge to accept the deal.
In a statement after the hearing, U.S. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said the Justice Department respected the court's decision and that the agreements had been entered ""only after the victims' attorneys informed me that the family was not opposed to it.""
Judges rarely reject plea agreements. Rejections can occur if judges believe the agreements do not adequately address the nature of the crimes, the rights of victims, or the interests of the public.
Wood said that under the plea agreement before her she would be bound to accept the 30-year federal sentence, and that she needed more information before she could decide if that was just.
""If I accept it, it locks me in to that sentence,"" she said.
Federal judges on occasion reject a plea agreement when they disagree with prosecutors' proposed sentence in order to avoid any surprises at the later sentencing hearing, according to Paul Applebaum, a criminal defense attorney in St. Paul, Minnesota.
""It's just the right thing to do if she has a problem with it,"" Applebaum said, adding that the two sides could continue negotiations for a different deal ahead of trial.
Arbery's killing sparked national outrage when cellphone video taken by Bryan of the shooting emerged months later and the public learned that local authorities had declined to arrest his pursuers.

- If enforced, COP26 pledges will limit warming - IEA
- Countries must follow through on pledges long-term
- 'We really mustn't lose sight of the 1.5C' - Stern
GLASGOW, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Net-zero emissions pledges and a commitment by leaders at the COP26 climate conference to cut methane, if enforced, could enable the world to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday.
""New @IEA analysis shows that fully achieving all net-zero pledges to date & the Global Methane Pledge by those who signed it would limit global warming to 1.8C,"" IEA chief Fatih Birol wrote on Twitter.
The comments, made a few days after the pledges were announced at the Glasgow summit, drew warnings of caution as the IEA's new assessment relies on countries and companies following through with their promises for years if not decades to come.

Nicholas Stern, who produced a landmark 2006 report on the economics of climate change, said COP26 was showing promise but told Reuters: ""All the estimates have their own uncertainties, but also it's the whole path that matters. You can't estimate a temperature just from a point.""
Taking note of the IEA report, he urged delegates at the U.N. conference to remember that, even as temperature projections improve, ""we really mustn't lose sight of the 1.5C"".
A global deal agreed in Paris in 2015 set the goal of preventing global warming above 1.5C - the limit that scientists say could prevent the most catastrophic and irreversible impacts of climate change.
To meet it, the IEA has said the world needs to eliminate new fossil fuel investments.
During a panel discussion in Glasgow on Wednesday, Birol said he asked his colleagues at the IEA to run climate models again, asking: ""What would it mean if all the pledges announced ... were to be implemented?""
His team reported to him Tuesday night the result, which was ""extremely encouraging,"" he said.
He acknowledged that some net-zero pledges were ""a bit longer-term horizons"". Big-emitter India on Monday announced it would aim to reach net zero only by 2070 - 20 years after scientists say is needed.
Nevertheless, with the potential for rapid impact from the promised drawdown of methane, Birol said: ""We would have a temperature increase trajectory that is 1.8 degrees Celsius.""
A U.N. report released days before the Glasgow talks said pledges to cut climate-warming emissions put the planet on course for a 2.7C temperature rise this century. read more
The discrepancy between that measure and the IEA assessment was likely due to the fact that the U.N. assessment looked only at country pledges known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, made ahead of the talks.
If you believe ""the NDCs plus the (new) net-zero pledges has put us on a pathway to 1.9 or 1.8, as the IEA said today, you're discounting the fact that none of those have been implemented,"" said EU climate negotiator Jacob Werksman.
The EU delegation was ""definitely excited"" about the IEA assessment, he said. ""But it can't lead to complacency. It would be insane if people said 'Now the work is done'.""
Non-governmental organisations said they could not confirm the IEA assessment, but were encouraged by the number of new pledges.
""I can't verify those numbers,"" said Jules Kortenhorst, CEO of RMI, a non-profit working on the global energy transition. Though ""the impact of the methane pledge is really enormous.""
Likewise, the rapid series of financial and company commitments has been ""very, very powerful, and is completely unrivalled"" by action at other COPs held over the last 15 years, Kortenhorst said.
CHANGE OF COURSE AT IEA
Birol's comments don't ""detract from the urgent need to close down coal production in this decade, and thereafter oil and gas,"" said Mark Campanale, founder and executive chair of Carbon Tracker, a London-based non-profit think tank.
On Thursday, 77 countries pledged to phase out coal, the dirtiest of the fossil fuels. But China and India, both heavily reliant on coal-fired power, were conspicuously absent.

486,"Most reported U.S. Omicron cases have hit the fully vaccinated -CDC/Eduardo Munoz
Dec 10  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that of the 43 cases attributed to Omicron variant, 34 people had been fully vaccinated. Fourteen of them had also received a booster, although five of those cases occurred less than 14 days after the additional shot before full protection kicks in.
While the numbers are very small, they add to growing concerns that current COVID-19 vaccines may offer less protection against the highly transmissible new variant.
The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has been found through testing in about 22 states so far after first being identified in southern Africa and Hong Kong in late November.
Among the Omicron cases, 25 were in people aged 18 to 39 and 14 had traveled internationally. Six people had previously been infected with the coronavirus.
Most of them only had mild symptoms such as coughing, congestion, and fatigue, the report said, and one person was hospitalized for two days. Other symptoms reported less frequently including nausea or vomiting, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, diarrhea and loss of taste or smell.
The CDC said that while many of the first reported Omicron cases appear to be mild, a lag exists between infection and more severe outcomes. Symptoms would also be expected to be milder in vaccinated persons and those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The first known U.S. Omicron case was identified on Dec 1 in a fully vaccinated person who had traveled to South Africa. The CDC said that the earliest date of symptom onset was Nov. 15 in a person with a history of international travel.

487,"U.S. core capital goods orders growth slows in April; shipments increase

- Summary
- Companies
- Core capital goods orders increase 0.3% in April
- Shipments of core capital goods rise 0.8%
- Durable goods orders gain 0.4%; shipments up 0.1%
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased less than expected in April, suggesting businesses could be slowing their pace of spending on equipment as they confront growing headwinds from rising interest rates and tightening financial conditions.
The mixed report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday followed on the heels of May regional factory surveys last week showing manufacturers expecting moderate growth in capital spending over the next six months. The Federal Reserve has adopted an aggressive monetary policy stance to cool demand and tame inflation, sparking a stock market sell-off and boosting U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar.
""Rate-sensitive business equipment investment growth is beginning to slow,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""That is consistent with our view that economic activity is bending rather than breaking under the impact of higher rates.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.3% last month. These so-called core capital goods orders advanced 1.1% in March. They were up 10.0% on a year-on-year basis.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders gaining 0.5%. The data are not adjusted for inflation, which also contributed to the gains in orders last month.
""When production inputs are more expensive, maintaining existing investment levels and replacing depreciating capital makes a business spend more dollars, even if the investment does not really expand capacity,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York.
Core capital goods orders were held back by modest gross domestic product measurement.
On Wall Street, stocks were trading higher following recent sharp losses. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, and U.S. Treasury debt prices were mostly up.
CLOUDS LOOMING
Robust business investment in equipment helped keep domestic demand strong in the first quarter even as the economy contracted at a 1.4% annualized rate, burdened by a record trade deficit. April's increase in core capital goods shipments suggested business spending would keep growing, though probably not at the 15.3% pace logged last quarter.
Despite the strong growth in shipments, clouds are looming over business spending and manufacturing. The Fed has raised its policy interest rate by 75 basis points since March. The U.S. central bank is expected to hike the overnight rate by half a percentage point at each of its next meetings in June and July.
Minutes of the Fed's May 3-4 meeting published on Wednesday showed a ""few participants indicated that some of their business contacts were reportedly hesitant to expand capacity or had postponed construction projects,"" although overall business investment remained underpinned by strong consumer demand, healthy household balance sheets and inventory rebuilding.
A survey from the New York Fed last week showed a measure of capital expenditures by businesses in New York state fell in May to its lowest level in several months. The Philadelphia Fed's gauge of future capital expenditures dropped to its lowest reading since February 2016, which the regional bank said suggested ""less widespread expectations for capital spending.""
China's zero COVID-19 policy, which led to the shutdown of the commercial hub of Shanghai, is likely to further entangle supply chains, hampering capital spending. Goldman Sachs trimmed its second-quarter GDP growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.4% rate on Wednesday's data.

- Summary
- Bill aims to concentrate regulatory power with state
- Bill seeks to reserve future lithium extraction for the state
- Lopez Obrador faces challenge getting law through Congress
MEXICO CITY, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Mexico's leftist government on Friday pitched a constitutional reform to boost state control of the electricity market, in a move to reverse business-friendly energy legislation enacted by the previous administration.
The reform announced by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador foresees giving the Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) over half of the power market and putting it in charge of setting terms for private generators.
According to a copy seen by Reuters, the bill Lopez Obrador sent to Congress on Thursday would also reserve future lithium extraction for the state and do away with energy regulators, grouping their functions under the Energy Ministry and the CFE.
Though Lopez Obrador had hinted at much of the bill's content, its elimination of nominally independent regulators even drew criticism from some of his erstwhile loyalists.
""The disappearance of the National Hydrocarbons Commission is a step back for the regulation of the energy sector,"" said Martha Barcena, Lopez Obrador's former ambassador to the United States, referring to the oil industry regulator.
Lopez Obrador said giving the CFE 54% of the power market would keep prices low for consumers and end preferential treatment for private firms, which he argues has been excessive.
""We are trying to compensate for the damage caused by the so-called energy reform,"" he told a news conference, referring to the previous administration's 2013-14 opening of the energy market to private capital.
The law currently gives preference to dispatching the lowest-cost power onto the grid, which is often produced by private companies. Lopez Obrador has spent much of his term trying to overhaul the energy sector in favor of the CFE and state oil and gas company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex).
Doing so has helped Pemex unload fuel oil it produces onto the CFE, which it can use for burning in power stations. But tighter sulfur content rules has restricted the market for fuel oil, posing a problem for the heavily-indebted Pemex.
Aside from eliminating the CNH, the law also foresees getting rid of the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE). The two were created years ago to be impartial market regulators.
LITHIUM
Although Mexico does not yet produce lithium, Lopez Obrador said eight existing concessions for extracting the metal would remain in private hands if companies can develop the industry.
Bacanora Lithium (BCNB.L), which holds concessions in northern Mexico, says it is getting close.
""They must prove they have done exploration work and have the capacity to invest and extract lithium,"" Lopez Obrador said.

497,"U.S. lawmakers call Tesla expansion in Xinjiang 'misguided'
WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The chairmen of two congressional panels on oversight and trade on Thursday assailed Tesla's (TSLA.O) expansion in China's far-western Xinjiang region, where detention camps have drawn heavy criticism, and asked the electric car maker about its Chinese product sourcing.
""Your misguided expansion into the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region sets a poor example and further empowers the (Chinese government),"" Democrats Bill Pascrell and Earl Blumenauer, who head two House of Representatives Ways and Means subcommittees, wrote in a joint letter to Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk.
Tesla made a New Year's Eve announcement that it opened a showroom in Xinjiang, becoming the latest foreign business caught up in tensions related to the region.
Xinjiang has become a significant point of conflict between Western governments and China in recent years. U.N. experts and rights groups estimate that more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in camps there.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

They also asked whether Tesla has any financial relationships with companies connected to Xinjiang and whether Tesla plans to expand into other regions in China.

- Summary
- U.S. jobless claims fall, but slowdown emerging
- Fed's Powell repeats commitment to tame inflation for 2nd day
- European PMIs come in softer than expected
NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - The euro slid across the board on Thursday as weaker-than-expected German and French PMI data showed that the euro zone economy is struggling to gain traction, prompting traders to trim bets on big rate-hike moves from the European Central Bank.
The dollar, on the other hand, rose against a major currency basket, as risk appetite soured, with safe-haven U.S. Treasuries in demand amid rising recession prospects.
Higher prices in the euro zone meant demand for manufactured goods fell in June at the fastest rate since May 2020 at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. The S&P Global's headline factory Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a near two- year low of 52.0 from 54.6. read more
""The (PMI) manufacturing/services ratio tends to be a good barometer for pro-cyclical currencies. The ratio has sharply dropped relative to the U.S.,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist in a research note.
""This dynamic is typically consistent with further U.S. dollar resilience. This could be bolstered as recession fears mount.""
Following the data, money markets priced in about 30 basis points (bps) of ECB rate hikes in July compared to 34 bps on Monday. Traders also trimmed expectations of how much the ECB will hike rates by the end of 2022 to 161 bps, compared to 176 bps on Monday.
In the United States, the U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, dropped to 51.2 in June from a final reading of 53.6 in May, S&P Global said on Thursday .

Against the dollar, the euro declined 0.5% to $1.0509. It earlier declined below a key $1.05 level for the third time this week. The euro also declined 1.4% versus the Japanese currency to 141.85 yen.
The euro's losses pulled the dollar away from earlier lows and sent the greenback into positive territory against its rivals after cautious comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday weighed on sentiment.
The dollar index rose 0.3% to 104.48 .
While markets have steadfastly held the view that the Fed will raise rates by another 75 bps in July, some analysts believe the ECB and Bank of England will adopt a softer tightening path or risk damaging growth.

Lebanon's Hezbollah chief, Nasrallah, says blast judge biased, should be replaced
- Summary
- Nasrallah says he wants ""transparent"" judge
- Lead judge due to question Hezbollah allies this week
- One year on, no top officials have been held accountable
BEIRUT, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Lebanon's Hezbollah chief, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, called on Monday for the replacement of the lead investigator into the deadly Beirut port blast, saying he was biased and politicised, in his strongest criticism of the official since his appointment.
""The targeting is clear, you are picking certain officials and certain people. The bias is clear,"" he said in televised comments, adding that Judge Tarek Bitar would never reach the truth if he continues with the probe.
Nasrallah openly called for Bitar's replacement, saying he wanted a judge that was ""transparent"".
Bitar is not permitted to speak to the media in his capacity as an investigating judge.
The investigation into the Aug. 4, 2020, explosion, one of the biggest non-nuclear blasts in history, has made little headway amid a campaign against Bitar and pushback from powerful Lebanese factions.
The blast killed over 200 people, injured thousands and destroyed large swathes of the capital, but no top official has been held accountable.
Wafik Safa, a senior official in the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah, warned Bitar last month the group would remove him from the inquiry, according to a journalist and a judicial source. read more
The justice minister and judiciary are following up on the warning.
Hezbollah has become one of the most powerful political players in Lebanon in recent years.
Bitar's efforts to question former and current state officials, including the prime minister at the time of the blast, former ministers and senior security officials on suspicion of negligence have been repeatedly blocked.
Legal complaints have also been filed questioning his impartiality.

BEIRUT, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Lebanon's Hezbollah chief, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, called on Monday for the replacement of the lead investigator into the deadly Beirut port blast, saying he was biased and politicised, in his strongest criticism of the official since his appointment.
""The targeting is clear, you are picking certain officials and certain people. The bias is clear,"" he said in televised comments, adding that Judge Tarek Bitar would never reach the truth if he continues with the probe.
Nasrallah openly called for Bitar's replacement, saying he wanted a judge that was ""transparent"".
Bitar is not permitted to speak to the media in his capacity as an investigating judge.
The investigation into the Aug. 4, 2020, explosion, one of the biggest non-nuclear blasts in history, has made little headway amid a campaign against Bitar and pushback from powerful Lebanese factions.
The blast killed over 200 people, injured thousands and destroyed large swathes of the capital, but no top official has been held accountable.
Wafik Safa, a senior official in the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah, warned Bitar last month the group would remove him from the inquiry, according to a journalist and a judicial source. read more
The justice minister and judiciary are following up on the warning.
Hezbollah has become one of the most powerful political players in Lebanon in recent years.
Bitar's efforts to question former and current state officials, including the prime minister at the time of the blast, former ministers and senior security officials on suspicion of negligence have been repeatedly blocked.
Legal complaints have also been filed questioning his impartiality. "

503,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Major central banks in sub-Saharan Africa will leave interest rates unchanged in coming days, starting with Nigeria and Kenya, and followed by Ghana at the end of the month, a Reuters poll suggested on Tuesday.
In a survey carried out in the past week, median forecasts showed analysts expected the central banks of Nigeria and Kenya to keep rates on hold at 11.50% and 7.00% respectively. Ghana was seen leaving borrowing costs at 14.50% next week.
“In Nigeria, FX policy will be the main focus of the MPC meeting, amid recent oil price strength,” Razia Khan of Standard Chartered said.
“While we expect the Central Bank of Kenya to keep its policy rate on hold at 7.00%, with inflation risks increasing, policy normalisation will likely be a key focus at the press conference,” Khan added.
Interest rates for these central banks have been relatively low since around 2015. However, Ghana and South Africa kicked off tightening last year, with the latter expected to hike rates again on Thursday to 4.00%. [ECILT/ZA]
Financial Derivatives wrote in a note that heightened inflationary pressures could force most central banks in Africa to adopt a contractionary monetary policy, following in the footsteps of some advanced economies.
Policymakers in the United States expect as many as three quarter-percentage-point rate increases this year, starting in March, with more likely in 2023 and 2024.
This development is expected to attract capital flows to the dollar, likely weakening local currencies and stoking inflation.
For that reason, not all respondents expected rates to stay on hold.

SHANGHAI, March 14 (Reuters) - Daily COVID-19 cases in the southern manufacturing hub of Guangdong province could surge to more than 75,000 if curbs are removed and travel is allowed to recover to a fifth of pre-pandemic levels, China's disease control body said.
As China's efforts to sustain its ""zero-COVID"" strategy come under growing scrutiny, Guangdong, which borders Hong Kong, is on the frontline of a new outbreak fuelled by highly infectious variants like Omicron.

MEXICO CITY, April 23 (Reuters) - Workers at a Panasonic auto parts plant in northern Mexico elected an independent union this week, marking another defeat for one of the country's biggest labor organizations as Mexico seeks to strengthen worker rights in line with a new trade deal.
Union SNITIS, which grew out of worker dissatisfaction with traditional labor groups in the northern state of Tamaulipas, won 75% of ballots in a two-day election in which 2,150 people were eligible to vote, Mexico's federal labor center said late on Friday.
The competing group, SIAMARM, part of the 86-year-old Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), won 25% at the factory, which makes car audio and display systems, mostly for U.S. and Canadian markets.
The result follows other recent votes against CTM, at a General Motors plant in the central state of Guanajuato and at auto parts plant Tridonex in Tamaulipas, both sites that faced U.S. scrutiny for potential worker rights abuses under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal, which came into force in 2020. read more [nL1N2V40DO]

- Summary
- Elizabeth, now 95, became queen on Feb. 6, 1952
- Britain plans celebrations to mark 70-year reign
- Monarch is hugely popular, but son Charles far less so
- Series of recent scandals has tarnished family's image
- Opponents of monarchy question institution's long-term future
WINDSOR, England, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Celebrations this year marking Queen Elizabeth's seven-decade reign will mask a less happy reality for the world's pre-eminent royal family: the British monarchy is being questioned in ways that were unthinkable for most of the last 70 years.
From the U.S. sex abuse court case facing son Prince Andrew to her grandson Prince Harry and his wife's allegations of racism in the royal household, rarely has the family of 95-year-old Elizabeth, who became queen on Feb. 6, 1952, faced such scrutiny and damaging headlines.
Such is the depth of respect for the queen that while she lives, the institution that goes back nearly 1,000 years looks safe. What comes next is less certain.
""The monarchy and the queen are synonymous for most people,"" Graham Smith, chief executive of anti-monarchy group Republic, which has stepped up its campaigning, told Reuters.
""Once we're past the end of the queen's reign, all bets are off as to where public opinion is going to go.""
He said while only an act of parliament would be needed to end the monarchy, it was highly likely there would have to be a referendum first.
The monarchy's fortunes have ebbed and flowed since her ancestor Norman King William I's 1066 conquest of England, but only during the decade that followed the execution of King Charles I in 1649 has Britain been a republic.

""The monarchy and the queen are synonymous for most people,"" Graham Smith, chief executive of anti-monarchy group Republic, which has stepped up its campaigning, told Reuters.
""Once we're past the end of the queen's reign, all bets are off as to where public opinion is going to go.""
He said while only an act of parliament would be needed to end the monarchy, it was highly likely there would have to be a referendum first.
The monarchy's fortunes have ebbed and flowed since her ancestor Norman King William I's 1066 conquest of England, but only during the decade that followed the execution of King Charles I in 1649 has Britain been a republic.

MADRID, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Spain's LaLiga has reached an agreement to sell its domestic broadcasting rights to Movistar and DAZN for 4.95 billion euros ($5.59 billion) over five years, it said in a statement on Monday.
The deal is a record for the top-flight soccer league as its last contract, signed with Telefonica in 2018, was a three-year agreement for 2.940 billion euros.
The rights will be split between the TV operator and the over-the-top (OTT) video streaming service. They will each have the rights to five games per week except for three weeks in the season when Movistar will have the rights to all matches.
The rights to broadcast matches to bars and restaurants and for the weekly game on non-subscription TV are not included in the deal and the bidding process for those will open in February or March 2022.
The agreement comes after clubs on Friday approved a 1.994 billion euro investment from private equity fund CVC Capital Partners in the first deal of its kind in Europe, although four clubs - including Barcelona and Real Madrid - opted out. read more

520,"Data collection in the EU: troubled waters for U.S. companies
REUTERS/Kacper Pempel
February 25, 2022 - The distance between the United States and Europe is approximately 4,000 miles, but when it comes to laws governing the treatment of online data collection and use, the gulf seems much wider and is growing.
The United States has always had a much different data privacy law regime than the EU. In the United States, there is no omnibus consumer privacy law on the federal level; rather, there are various sectoral laws dealing with issues such as health care, financial services and children's data and a wide variety of laws on the state level.
Meanwhile, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect in 2018, is a comprehensive law that contains 99 articles and 173 recitals and applies to all member countries. The disconnect between the jurisdictions has always been challenging, and now recent developments have made compliance for U.S.-based technology companies even more difficult.
<b>Standard contractual clauses</b>
Pursuant to Chapter 5 of the GDPR, transfers of personal data to a country outside of the EU can only take place where that country ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights of EU data subjects. The European Commission (Commission) has deemed the U.S. to be inadequate under this standard. U.S. and EU regulators had negotiated formal programs to make cross-border data transfers to the United States GDPR-compliant. These programs allowed U.S. companies to register and self-certify compliance with a series of privacy principles. Once registered, the U.S. company would itself be deemed adequate in order to receive personal data from the EU.
The first program, the US-EU Safe Harbor program, was invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in 2015 as a result of a lawsuit from privacy advocate Max Schrems who convinced the court that the program did not offer an adequate level of protection from U.S. surveillance activities for EU data subjects. The parties negotiated a replacement program, the EU-US Privacy Shield, and that program was invalidated by the CJEU as well in 2020 in the so-called ""Schrems II"" ruling.
In the absence of an adequacy decision, the GDPR requires that companies implement appropriate safeguards, including enforceable data subject rights and legal remedies. The most frequently used mechanism has been the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) — a contract pre-approved by the Commission that establishes certain controls to safeguard data as per EU standards.

521,"Modernising UAE leader Khalifa moved UAE closer to U.S.
United Arab Emirate President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan attends the opening of the two-day Arab Summit in Damascus March 29, 2008. REUTERS/Jamal Saidi
- Summary
- Low-key Sheikh Khalifa sought to balance UAE interests
- Khalifa moved United Arab Emirates closer to Washington
- His ailing health left crown prince in charge since 2014
DUBAI, May 13 halifa, who was born in 1948, had been ruler of the richest emirate, Abu Dhabi, and UAE president since the death of his father, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, in 2004 but had rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2014.
Since then, he had continued to hold ceremonial powers but had allowed his half-brother, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, to hold the true reins of power. The UAE has pursued a hawkish foreign policy against Iran and Islamist groups and, in a strategic realignment of Middle East countries against Iran, forged formal ties with Israel two years ago.
Khalifa lacked the charisma of his late father, who united the country's seven emirates into a federation in 1971.
But his personable nature and subtle approach helped maintain the ruling family's ties with important clans and leaders of other emirates during the fall-out from a debt crisis in Dubai in 2009 and a tense era in regional politics.
The eldest of his father's 19 sons, Khalifa was a careful financial manager who was keen to further modernise the UAE, an OPEC oil producer. Even before Zayed's death, he had long played a pivotal role in running the UAE due to his father's illness and focus on foreign affairs.
Khalifa had led the Supreme Petroleum Council, which sets oil policy, and the sovereign wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, believed to control an estimated $700 billion in global assets. Both are powerful positions that he held as crown prince for 35 years, grooming him for leadership.
Khalifa grew up before the 1970s oil boom flooded the UAE with the petrodollars that turned it into a regional economic powerhouse.
Abu Dhabi is the political capital, by virtue of its immense oil wealth, while Dubai, under the leadership of the al-Maktoum family, is the Gulf's business and tourism hub.
It was on Khalifa's watch that the UAE, a grouping of sheikhdoms that emerged five decades ago from British colonial tutelage, witnessed a subtle shift in its political landscape as the federation became more centralised under Abu Dhabi guidance.
UAE rulers faced the delicate question in 2009 of how to handle the financial troubles in Dubai as the global economic crisis took hold. Abu Dhabi bailed it out with $20 billion in financing to avoid debt defaults.
Dubai expressed its gratitude by switching the name of its tallest skyscraper from Burj Dubai to Burj Khalifa in a reflection of the political realities.
POLITICAL SHIFTS
While UAE founder Zayed championed popular Arab causes, leading a public effort to stop the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, under Khalifa the UAE became more clearly associated with Arab states allied with Washington.
The UAE joined a U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Syria and took a leading role in a Saudi-led alliance that intervened in Yemen's war in 2015 against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, deploying Emirati troops on the ground.
Abu Dhabi firmly backed international sanctions against Iran in 2012 over its nuclear energy programme despite the emirate's traditional role as a trade hub for Iran.
This eased the way for the UAE to pursue plans to develop its own civilian nuclear energy with international oversight and Washington's blessing. It also spent billions of dollars in arms, mainly from the United States, to shore up its defences.
The United States brokered the deal that led to the establishment of ties with Israel in September 2020. Bahrain also forged ties with Israel the same day, and Sudan and Morocco quickly followed suit.

The company added it also intends to fully repay the second tranche, worth 1 billion euros, before the end of this year.

""Today, we are keeping our promise and paying back a large part of the stabilization funds earlier than expected. We are increasingly confident about the future,"" said Chief Executive Carsten Spohr.
He added demand for flights, especially from business travellers, was growing daily, though the market remained challenging.
The airline also aims to terminate an unused portion of the first participation tranche before the end of 2021. A state loan of 1 billion euros was repaid in February.
Lufthansa said last week its rights issue was 98.36% subscribed by investors, and the remainder was quickly sold in the open market. read more
The airline last year received a 9 billion euro government bailout to stay afloat through the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the German state's Economic Stabilisation Fund (ESF) taking 15% of Lufthansa's shares.
That stake was trimmed in the rights issue to 14.09%.

LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - The West must learn from its mistakes in failing to deter Russia's invasion of Ukraine and apply those lessons to ""protect peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"",.
Truss said the West, and in particular countries in the Indo-Pacific region, had to make sure Taiwan was defended.
""We need to learn the lessons of Ukraine, which was that we could have ensured that Ukraine had the defensive capability earlier,"" Truss told LBC radio.

WASHINGTON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The chair of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, concerned about worker shortages at airlines that received billions of dollars in government assistance, has invited CEOs of seven major U.S. carriers to testify at a Dec. 8 hearing, airlines and a committee official told Reuters.

530,"In a faceoff with Elon Musk, the SEC blinked

- Summary

- Judge's remarks in 2019 knocked SEC's confidence court would back them
- Core issue - what is ""material"" information - was left to Musk and Tesla to decide
- As some tweets went unvetted, SEC opted to urge Musk to comply, rather than go to court
- SEC was also uneasy about risk of starting litigation given Musk's resources
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators have pulled their punches in dealings with Elon Musk largely because an April 2019 court hearing on a statement he made about Tesla on Twitter didn't go their way, according to four sources with knowledge of the matter.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked the court to hold the billionaire in contempt, saying a tweet by the Tesla Inc. (TSLA.O) CEO - which forecast production at the carmaker - violated a court agreement Musk signed the previous year to have some of his communications vetted by a lawyer.
By trying to rein in his comments, the SEC was veering into relatively uncharted territory. SEC rules require that public companies and their executives disclose accurate information that may be material to investors via channels that investors know to monitor. It doesn't usually specify how companies should do that.
But the 2019 remarks by judge Alison Nathan – who found the terms of the agreement between Musk and the SEC to be ""soft"" and urged them to reach an understanding – knocked confidence among officials overseeing the case that the courts would support them if they attempted to prosecute his activity on Twitter (TWTR.N), the four sources said.
Interviews with individuals familiar with the situation – as well as a review of court documents, SEC and Tesla emails obtained by the media through a public records request – showed that in the wake of Nathan's comments, SEC officials opted to urge Musk to comply with the agreement, rather than pursuing enforcement through the courts.
Spokespeople for the SEC declined to comment on its enforcement dealings with Musk. Spokespeople for Tesla and Twitter and a representative for Judge Nathan did not respond to requests for comment for this story.
Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, did not respond to requests for comment on the SEC's deliberations, but court records and Tesla emails show he and other lawyers for the Tesla boss dispute that Musk's tweets violated the agreement.
With Musk's use of social media under scrutiny after he bid to purchase Twitter, the interviews and documents shed light on the regulator's view of its relationship with the billionaire, now the world's richest man.

531,"Armed convoy moves into Tripoli to shore up interim PM
TRIPOLI, Feb 12 (Reuters) - A convoy of fighters moved into Tripoli from the Libyan city of Misrata on Saturday to shore up the interim prime minister amid a push by the parliament to oust him in favour of its own candidate.
Interim Prime Minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah has sworn he will hand over power only after an election and has rejected the move by parliament this week to appoint former interior minister Fathi Bashagha to head a new government.
The convoy's arrival underscored the danger of renewed fighting in Libya as the crisis plays out, following mobilisations in recent weeks by armed factions backing different political sides.
Saturday's convoy, comprising more than 100 vehicles according to a Reuters witness, arrived after Dbeibah earlier on Saturday accused the parliament of being ""responsible for all this bloodshed and chaos"" in Libya over recent years.
The parliament speaker, Aguila Saleh, has accused Dbeibah of corruption and of seeking to use his position for his own ends rather than to effect a meaningful transition.
Libya has had little peace since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising against Muammar Gaddafi and it split in 2014 between warring factions in east and west.
During the war, the parliament mostly sided with the eastern-based forces of Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). The main armed forces from Misrata were on the other side, backing the then internationally recognised government in Tripoli.
Dbeibah was installed last year as head of the Government of National Unity (GNU), a body that was put in place through a U.N.-backed process to unify Libya's divided institutions and oversee the run-up to elections in December.
After the election process collapsed amid factional disputes over the rules, the parliament moved to take control of the political process by declaring a new ""roadmap"" to elections and replacing the interim government.
This week it asked Bashagha to form a new government after a session in which the speaker said the only other candidate had withdrawn and then voted the former interior minister in with a quick show of hands.

533,"The latest revelation is that fans of the Kardashian family were able to spot Rob in the birth of his daughter, North, shortly after his mother gave birth. The fans spotted Rob briefly, as they saw him in a birth announcement. The fans have a reason to cheer. Kris Jenner loves being in the spotlight, and she’s used it to her advantage, making five of her daughters household names.
“KUWTK” filming was halted for a few days while the family attended Kim’s wedding. Khloe Kardashian did not leave her side, and the two were seen on the same set of cameras. The cameras weren’t set up at the hospital, so the only footage of Kris was taken from West’s camera phone. In fact, it’s likely that Kim didn’t have a camera crew with her at the birth.
Despite the tensions, Rob Kardashian was quick to reassure his mom. After all, he’s been a dad for several years, and now he’s an expert on parenting. While they may not have a romantic relationship, they’ve been spotted together on many occasions. Rob Kardashian’s baby, Suzie, was born a few months after the birth of Kris Jenner.
In addition to his daughter Dream, Rob Kardashian was briefly spotted in his mom’s birth. In the episode, he joined the family to celebrate the birthday of their grandmother Mary Jo “MJ” Houghton. The fans were able to see Rob in the reflection of windows and see his smiling face. So, if you’re a fan of the Kardashians, don’t miss your chance to catch this new celebrity.
While fans were delighted to spot Rob in his mom’s birth, their surprise was hardly surprising. The couple recently announced their engagement and were excited about the news of the baby. Meanwhile, the reality TV star – Kris Jenner-had been spotted in her mom’s birth, as well as the birth of her daughter, Blac Chyna. The couple subsequently celebrated the couple’s birthday with a lavish dinner for the two.

The KUWTK cast is now set to return. It will be interesting to see how the new additions fit into the on-screen dynamic. The show’s trailer has a lot of speculation about Rob Kardashian’s role, but it’s safe to say that he has taken a step back from the spotlight in recent years. Thankfully, both Rob and Khloe make brief appearances in the new episodes. The addition of Travis Scott may be beneficial for Kourt and Scott’s on-screen dynamic, but no one has yet confirmed it. However, fans have been able to record the new trailer, which could raise their hopes for the Jenner sisters to take center stage.
In 2014, Khloe and Rob welcomed a baby girl.

The fans spotted Rob briefly, as they saw him in a birth announcement. The fans have a reason to cheer. Kris Jenner loves being in the spotlight, and she’s used it to her advantage, making five of her daughters household names.
“KUWTK” filming was halted for a few days while the family attended Kim’s wedding. Khloe Kardashian did not leave her side, and the two were seen on the same set of cameras. The cameras weren’t set up at the hospital, so the only footage of Kris was taken from West’s camera phone. In fact, it’s likely that Kim didn’t have a camera crew with her at the birth.
Despite the tensions, Rob Kardashian was quick to reassure his mom. After all, he’s been a dad for several years, and now he’s an expert on parenting. While they may not have a romantic relationship, they’ve been spotted together on many occasions. Rob Kardashian’s baby, Suzie, was born a few months after the birth of Kris Jenner.
In addition to his daughter Dream, Rob Kardashian was briefly spotted in his mom’s birth. In the episode, he joined the family to celebrate the birthday of their grandmother Mary Jo “MJ” Houghton. The fans were able to see Rob in the reflection of windows and see his smiling face. So, if you’re a fan of the Kardashians, don’t miss your chance to catch this new celebrity.
While fans were delighted to spot Rob in his mom’s birth, their surprise was hardly surprising. The couple recently announced their engagement and were excited about the news of the baby. Meanwhile, the reality TV star – Kris Jenner-had been spotted in her mom’s birth, as well as the birth of her daughter, Blac Chyna. The couple subsequently celebrated the couple’s birthday with a lavish dinner for the two.

The KUWTK cast is now set to return. It will be interesting to see how the new additions fit into the on-screen dynamic. The show’s trailer has a lot of speculation about Rob Kardashian’s role, but it’s safe to say that he has taken a step back from the spotlight in recent years. Thankfully, both Rob and Khloe make brief appearances in the new episodes. The addition of Travis Scott may be beneficial for Kourt and Scott’s on-screen dynamic, but no one has yet confirmed it. However, fans have been able to record the new trailer, which could raise their hopes for the Jenner sisters to take center stage.

BEIJING, Jan 11 (Reuters) -.
Tianjin, which has tightened controls on people leaving the city, on Tuesday closed indoor venues such as gyms and bars in one district with over 800,000 people.
The outbreak in Tianjin has been linked to cases in the city of Anyang in the central Chinese province of Henan, where there have been 84 confirmed infections since Saturday.
Anyang, which reported on Monday two local Omicron infections traced to a student arriving from Tianjin, has ordered its 5.5 million residents to remain at home unless going out for a COVID test or essential jobs.
The country's Omicron surge comes just weeks before the Lunar New Year, a peak travel period for millions, and cities across China are advising people to stay put, especially as Beijing prepares to host the Winter Olympics at the start of next month.
Zhang Boli, a government medical adviser, told state broadcaster CCTV on Tuesday that Omicron ""can't be taken lightly"" even if the symptoms among Omicron infections in Tianjin appeared to be not as severe as previous variants.
China has ordered the cancellation of more than two dozen scheduled flights from the United States after numerous passengers tested positive for COVID-19 when they arrived in China. read more

542,"Mexican president names salary of critical journalist in row over reporting
MEXICO CITY, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Friday revealed what he said was the salary of a prominent journalist, arguing the public had a right to know about the financial interests of his administration's critics.
Lopez Obrador set out the earnings of Carlos Loret de Mola, a journalist who has published a string of damning reports about the government, and who recently reported details on the lifestyle of one of the president's sons in Texas.
He told a regular news conference the journalist earned far more than he did in 2021, comparing their wages on a screen.
""Do you think this is because he's a high-flying, very intelligent journalist, a good writer? No! It's because of his hatchet jobs,"" Lopez Obrador said, explaining he had to defend his political project of ending injustice and corruption.
""This is not a personal matter,"" he added. ""My conscience is clear.""
Lopez Obrador, who slashed his own presidential salary when he took office in late 2018, said he had earned just over 2 million pesos ($98,000) before tax last year. He did not make clear where the information on Loret's earnings came from.
Loret quickly responded.
""What a thing! Using finance ministry data to go after a journalist. And the data are also wrong, inflated sums! He says I earned millions in 2021 at (broadcaster) Televisa ... where I stopped working in 2019,"" Loret said on Twitter.
Lopez Obrador, who sets great store by his personal austerity and moral authority, has variously described Loret as a ""mercenary,"" ""corrupt"" and ""lacking principles.""

NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit accusing Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, of violating U.S. securities laws by selling unregistered tokens and failing to register as an exchange or broker-dealer.

NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit accusing Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, of violating U.S. securities laws by selling unregistered tokens and failing to register as an exchange or broker-dealer.
The lawsuit had been brought in Manhattan by digital token investors who had bought nine tokens - EOS, QSP, KNC, TRX, FUN, ICX, OMG, LEND and ELF - through Binance's online exchange starting in 2017, and which soon lost much of their value.
In a 327-page complaint, the investors claimed that Binance ""wrongfully engaged in millions of transactions"" and failed to warn them about the ""significant risks"" of buying the tokens, and sought to recoup what they paid.

549,"Analysis: Ukraine war rekindles Europe's demand for African oil and gas
- Summary
- Companies
- Potential for African projects costing up to $100 bln
- Namibia oil discoveries could generate 500,000 bpd
- Oil majors' steps dovetail with push by European governments
- Africa sees golden chance to tap assets amid energy transition
BRUSSELS/LONDON/CAPE TOWN, July 22 (Reuters) - Europe's thirst for oil and gas to replace sanctioned Russian supply is reviving interest in African energy projects that were shunned due to costs and climate change concerns, industry executives and African officials said.
Energy firms are considering projects worth a total of $100 billion on the continent, according to Reuters calculations based on public and private company estimates.
African countries that currently have little or no oil and gas output could see billions in energy investments in the coming years, including Namibia, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania.
Namibia alone could provide around half a million barrels per day in new oil production, following promising exploratory wells in recent months, according to unpublished estimates by two industry consultants.
Africa as a whole could replace as much as one-fifth of Russian gas exports to Europe by 2030, based on estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The Paris-based watchdog said an additional 30 billion cubic metres (bcm) of African gas a year could flow to Europe by then.
""As the world seeks to replace Russian oil and gas volumes ... the industry is now focusing on the advantaged barrels Africa has to offer,"" said Gil Holzman, CEO of Canadian oil explorer Eco Atlantic Oil & Gas, which holds interests in oil licenses in nearly 30,000 square kilometers offshore Namibia.
""The majors have been building larger positions ... competitively bidding for exploration, development and production acreage,"" he told Reuters by e-mail, citing activity in the oil basins off Namibia and South Africa.
European sanctions on Russian oil supply and reduced gas flows have sent prices soaring and driven up inflation to 40-year records in some countries. Benchmark Brent crude in March reached near a 15-year high of $139 a barrel.
Investment in African energy has yet to recover from a plunge in oil and gas prices in 2014, the IEA said in a June report, highlighting Africa's potential to ease the supply crunch. Global oil output is set to rise from the pandemic but is then forecast to ebb in the late 2020s, it said.
""We are in the middle of the first truly global energy crisis and we have to find solutions to replace the loss of Russian oil and gas,"" IEA executive director Fatih Birol told Reuters in an interview in June.
The IEA shocked the oil industry last year by envisioning no investment in new fossil fuel projects in order to meet net zero emissions goals by mid-century.
Companies and countries eyeing oil and gas investments in Africa are aware they must move fast to profit from untapped reserves before the global transition to low carbon technology renders many fossil fuel projects unviable, the executives and officials said, as domestic fuel and power demand also rises.

569,"Private fund advisers to spell out fees, performance under new U.S. SEC proposals
The seal of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seen at their headquarters in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 12, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly
WASHINGTON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday voted to propose heightened regulations meant to scrutinize how private fund advisers charge fees to investors and measure fund performance.
The rule changes, which must undergo public consultation before they can be adopted, would require private fund advisers, such as private equity firms and hedge funds, to disclose to investors quarterly details about their fees and expenses, in a bid to shed light on the rapidly growing market sector.
An SEC-registered fund adviser, under the proposal, would also have to obtain annual audits for each private fund under management, as well as disclose so-called ""fairness opinions"" that summarize certain business relationships.
The measures would also seek to bar advisers from activities the SEC deems ""contrary"" to the public interest and investor protection, while also prohibiting preferential treatment unless disclosed to current and prospective investors, it said.
Such contrary behavior includes an adviser seeking reimbursement or limitation of its liability for a breach of fiduciary duty and granting preferential treatment for certain investors regarding information about portfolio holdings or exposures, among other behaviors, the SEC said.
Armed with billions of dollars, such firms took advantage of what had been a record 2021 for mergers and acquisitions.
Private equity buyouts surged 133% to $818 billion in the first nine months of 2021 as investment firms rushed to deploy cash, often paying rich prices to take assets off the public markets, according to Refinitiv data.
Some firms banded together into ""club deals,"" in what some market watchers said could be a growing trend.
SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has said investors should have more insight into such mega deals. The SEC voted 3 to 1 in favor of the proposed rules at a Wednesday open meeting.
New rules are essential for private funds -- like hedge funds, private equity funds, venture capital funds and liquidity funds -- because better visibility must match their growth in size, complexity and number, Gensler said of the sector that has nearly $18 trillion in gross assets.
""Beyond their size, though, these funds matter because of what, or who, stands on either side of them...the advisers, through the funds they manage, touch so much of our economy. It's worth asking whether we can promote more efficiency, competition and transparency in this field,"" he added.
Private fund trade groups, including the American Investment Council and the Managed Funds Association, criticized the SEC's proposal as ""unnecessary"" and ""misguided,"" while emphasizing existing industry standards that put investors first.
""We are concerned that these new regulations...will not strengthen pension returns or help companies innovate and compete in a global marketplace,"" said Drew Maloney, who leads the American Investment Council.
Bryan Corbett, who leads the group that represents hedge funds, the Managed Funds Association, said the proposed changes would ""harm the most sophisticated investors, including pensions, endowments and foundations, who rely on these funds to serve their beneficiaries.""
FASTER SETTLEMENTS
The commission also proposed a rule that would reduce the time between the execution of a securities transaction and its settlement from two business days after a trade date to one business day. The proposal would also mandate new recordkeeping and contract transparency between broker dealers, investment advisers and their clients.

Private fund trade groups, including the American Investment Council and the Managed Funds Association, criticized the SEC's proposal as ""unnecessary"" and ""misguided,"" while emphasizing existing industry standards that put investors first.
""We are concerned that these new regulations...will not strengthen pension returns or help companies innovate and compete in a global marketplace,"" said Drew Maloney, who leads the American Investment Council.
Bryan Corbett, who leads the group that represents hedge funds, the Managed Funds Association, said the proposed changes would ""harm the most sophisticated investors, including pensions, endowments and foundations, who rely on these funds to serve their beneficiaries.""
FASTER SETTLEMENTS
The commission also proposed a rule that would reduce the time between the execution of a securities transaction and its settlement from two business days after a trade date to one business day. The proposal would also mandate new recordkeeping and contract transparency between broker dealers, investment advisers and their clients.

ANTITHESIS OF ARK INNOVATION ETF ENJOY RALLY (1351 GMT/ 0851 ET)
ARK Innovation ETF is down nearly 3% in premarket trading on Tuesday, in tandem with broad tech wreak caused by a spike in U.S. bond yields and fears of faster than anticipated U.S. rate hikes.
Investment products betting against the ETF, however, have raced ahead.
Three times short ARK Innovation ETF is up 8% in London on Tuesday, bringing gains for the year to over 70%, while the underlying ETF down 15% YTD.
Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF (SARK.O), that tracks the inverse of the daily performance of the ARKK by entering via swap contracts, has gained over 50% since its launch on Nov. 9.
Popular investor Cathie Wood's flagship ETF that consists of high-growth, high-valuation companies has halved from its all-time peak in Feb 2021. It was the top-performing U.S. equity fund tracked by Morningstar in 2020 before plummeting to among the worst performers of 2021.
So far this month, the ARK Innovation ETF has bled nearly $240 million in investment outflows, according to Lipper data. By contrast, SARK drew in $45 million in the week ended Jan 12, the largest weekly inflow since the ETF's inception.

EUROPEAN EQUITIES POISED FOR GROWTH (1201 GMT)
A survey from BofA shows that investors see monetary tightening as the key risk for markets, which beats both COVID and inflation as top perceived risks.
Yet, investor bullishness remains unfazed by central bank tightening plans, BofA says.
Some 81% of 374 respondents with $1.2tn in assets under management expect European equities to rise by at least 5-10% this year.
Banks, insurance and industrials are the largest sector overweights, while tech dropped out of the top three to an underweight position for the first time in four years.
""The net proportion of investors saying they are overweight banks hit a new high, with that for insurance rising to the highest level since 2014,"" BofA says.
Investors also remain bullish on cyclicals versus defensives.

SEEKING VALUE? CHECK OUT THE MILAN BOURSE (1124 GMT)
On way to play the portfolio shift towards the value segment of the stock market is doing that through the Milan bourse, which is rich in banks and other cheaply priced stocks that could benefit from a surge in interest rates globally.
UBS has taken a fresh look at Italian stocks and remains overweight the space, even though the presidential election this month could heat up the political climate, creating turbulence.
""Italy is one of the European markets most heavily exposed to Value – a style we continue to expect to perform well over coming months,"" say economists and strategists at the Swiss investment bank led by Felix Huefner.
On top of that they also highlight:
- Attractive valuations with a dividend yield over 50% above that of Europe and a P/E relative close to a 20yr low
- Earnings momentum relative to the wider European market is at a 4yr high
- Italian equity performance normally correlates highly to European Banks and most recently it has lagged behind somewhat
So what about the political risks?
""Near-term political concerns must be monitored as equity performance moves closely with the BTP-Bund spread (a reflection of macro and political nervousness). As it stands, our macro team’s forecast of a 150bps spread over the medium term seems likely manageable for the equity market,"" they say.

BOJ? NOT THAT HAWKISH AFTER ALL (1120 GMT)
With investors focused on future central banks’ moves, a hawkish outcome from the Bank of Japan's policy meeting might have applied some upward pressure on bond yields globally.
But, according to John Vail, Chief Global Strategist, Nikko Asset Management, overall, BOJ was “relatively dovish,” even if “coupled with a moderately more positive outlook for the economy.”
“The BOJ also cut its gull year 2023 GDP forecast a bit to 1.1%, which is a disappointment, but that is about the natural growth rate for Japan, so it’s not too surprising,” he says.
“In sum, it raised its assessment of the economy but also said economic risks are to the downside, likely due to worrisome oil prices and geopolitics,” he adds.
“The policy update has in reality though proved less eventful,” MUFG analysts say, after mentioning speculation about BOJ debating a possible rate hike if inflation perks up.
The Bank of Japan raised its inflation forecasts on Tuesday but said it was in no rush to change its ultra-loose monetary policy, as rising prices fan speculation it may soon signal a shift in its decade-old stimulus experiment. read more

TECH TROUBLE (0754 GMT)
Nasdaq futures are down almost 1% on Tuesday, making it likely the tech-heavy index will add to its year-to-date losses of around 4.5%. Having risen for 12 of the past 13 years, it is under heavy pressure from the prospect of higher interest rates and bond yields, more so than the broader S&P 500 index or MSCI's global equity benchmark.
The 4.5% loss masks deeper falls -- 29 shares have lost 10% or more already this year, according to Capital Economics.
Nasdaq futures positioning has shifted dramatically short, Citi analysts point out, noting that $2 billion worth of remaining long positions are deep in the red.
Those investors will be looking nervously towards bond markets, where two-year U.S. Treasury borrowing costs have risen above 1% for the first time since Feb. 2020. In Europe, German 10-year yields are close to bursting above 0% for the first time since mid-2019.
Inflation is front and centre, as crude oil prices hit seven-year prices. That's good news for some -- the Bank of Japan signalled earlier the country was finally emerging sustainably out of deflation -- but the bond selloff is setting the stage for a dismal stock market session; most Asian bourses fell and Europe looks set to open weaker.
All eyes on central banks now. The U.S. Federal Reserve is now more or less priced to start lifting interest rates from March, Canada could move as early as next week while Britain's forecast-beating labour data on Tuesday, makes it all but certain the Bank of England's Feb 2 meeting will yield a hike.

VIENNA, March 3 (Reuters) - The stock of enriched uranium amassed by Iran in breach of its 2015 nuclear deal is growing to the point that its most highly-enriched material is most of the way to a common bomb yardstick, a report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog showed on Thursday.
The amount in the quarterly International Atomic Energy Agency report to member states seen by Reuters comes as negotiators at talks on salvaging the 2015 deal say they are in the final stretch. Western powers have warned time is running out before Iran's nuclear progress makes the talks pointless.
The report showed Iran's stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% fissile purity had almost doubled, increasing by 15.5 kg to 33.2 kg (46 to 110 pounds). A senior diplomat said that is around three-quarters of the amount needed, if enriched further, for one nuclear bomb according to a common definition.
That definition - 25 kg of uranium enriched to 90% - is a theoretical yardstick and how much is needed in real life would depend on further processes the material would still have to go through to make an actual bomb, the senior diplomat cautioned.

577,"Who steps in if cops become robbers?
- Law firms
(Reuters) - Brookside Police Department in Alabama has made the criminalization of poorer residents and passers-by the tiny town’s leading industry, according to a striking expose published on Wednesday.
The report on the news website AL.com tells a two-year story of a town that is symbolic of a nationwide problem: predatory law enforcement and policing for profits.
The overt nature of the apparent abuses of power in Brookside begs an immediate response from the various state and federal officials responsible for upholding the fair administration of justice in Alabama, especially where an entire law enforcement system was apparently subverted.
The report also spotlights, yet again, the sort of abuses enabled by the U.S. Supreme Court's broad grants of legal immunity to law enforcement officials.
A Department of Justice spokeswoman told me the agency is aware of the reporting on Brookside and “will consider that information, along with other information we may receive” in deciding if an investigation into a pattern of unconstitutional law enforcement “may be appropriate.”
The Brookside Police Department didn’t respond to requests for comment.
The Jan. 19 report says that Police Chief Mike Jones was Brookside’s only officer in 2018, and the town of about 1,250 had reported almost no serious crimes for the previous eight years.
Brookside has a short, 1.5-mile portion of Interstate 22 within its jurisdiction, and it brought in $82,467 in traffic fines in 2018. That made for about 14% of its total income – a relatively high proportion.
By 2020, Brookside had nine officers, and they were making vastly more traffic stops. Town revenue from fines and police seizures of people’s property surged to $610,000, about half its income, AL.com reported. Brookside ultimately doubled its revenue, and now spends more money funding its police than it did on every city expenditure, in total, just two years ago.
Now, the town faces multiple lawsuits and public accusations -- from residents and drivers, criminal justice advocates, the Jefferson County District Attorney and even cops in neighboring jurisdictions -- that they are running a money-making racket, in violation of constitutional rights, rather than protecting public safety.

HOUSTON, June 7 (Reuters) - LyondellBasell Industries (LYB.N)plans to shut its Houston oil refinery by the end of next year but could close it sooner if an equipment failure hits major units, according to two people familiar with the company's operations.
Such a move could heighten the risk of fuel shortages in the United States and pressure fuel prices, already sky-high due to the economy's recovery from pandemic and disrupted global flows following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
In April, the chemical maker said it would cease operating the 263,776-barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery by the end of 2023, exiting motor fuels production. It cited the cost of needed overhauls.
Lyondell spokesperson Chevalier Gray said the company previously annouced ""it will cease operations of the Houston refinery no later than Dec. 31, 2023.""
""In the interim, the company will continue serving the fuels market, which is expected to remain strong near-term,"" Gray said. ""The company determined that exiting the refining business, by the end of next year, is the best strategic and financial path forward.""
At least five oil-processing plants also shut during the pandemic, leaving the United States structurally short of capacity for the first time in decades. The U.S. also faces a well-above average hurricane season this year with about half the refining capacity along the Gulf Coast. read more

Oct 5 (Reuters) - London copper prices fell on Tuesday as dollar gained strength, amid tepid trade as markets in top consumer China were closed for a public holiday.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange shed 0.9% to $9,167 a tonne by 0616 GMT, aluminium fell 0.3% to $2,908 a tonne, nickel eased 0.2% to $17,890 a tonne and zinc advanced 0.2% to $3,022 a tonne.
The U.S. dollar edged toward a one-year high against major peers, making greenback-priced metals more expensive to holders of other currencies, ahead of a key payrolls report at the end of the week that could boost the case for the Federal Reserve to start tapering stimulus as soon as next month.
“Without the crude (oil) story, we should have drifted lower on strong U.S. dollar and more dominos falling in China. It’s a drift lower with spikes higher when China eases Evergrande uncertainty issues,” said a Singapore-based metals trader.

- F1 says impossible to race in Russia in current circumstances
- Cancellation shortens calendar to 22 races
Feb 25 (Reuters) - Formula One on Friday said it will not race in Russia this season, saying it was ""impossible"" to do so after the country invaded neighbouring Ukraine.
The race was scheduled for Sept. 25 at Sochi's Olympic park, but will now be dropped from the calendar for the first time since it debuted in 2014.
""We are watching the developments in Ukraine with sadness and shock and hope for a swift and peaceful resolution to the present situation,"" the sport said in a statement.
""On Thursday evening Formula One, the FIA, and the teams discussed the position of our sport, and the conclusion is ... that it is impossible to hold the Russian Grand Prix in the current circumstances.""
Formula One drivers backed the sport's call.
""I'm also personally affected, having some people close to me who are in Ukraine right now,"" Frenchman Pierre Gasly said in a news conference on the final day of the Barcelona pre-season test.
""Personally, I would have found it very difficult to catch a plane and land in a country that is at war,"" added Ferrari's Spaniard Carlos Sainz.
F1's decision was announced shortly after UEFA said it had moved the Champions League final from from St Petersburg to Paris.
Four-time champion Sebastian Vettel told reporters on Thursday he would not race in Russia even if the race went ahead. Reigning champion Max Verstappen said it was ""not correct"" to race in a country at war.
On Friday Mercedes new recruit George Russell said the drivers had been united in their stand.
""Fortunately the guys at the helm of F1 and the FIA came to a conclusion very quickly so we didn't have to make any difficult decisions,"" he added.
Nikita Mazepin is the sole Russian driver on the sport's grid.
His U.S.-owned Haas team ran their car in Barcelona testing on Friday in an all-white livery, having taken off all branding representing title sponsor and Russian potash producer Uralkali, which is owned by his father.
Team principal Guenther Steiner acknowledged the Russian faces an uncertain future.
Mazepin withdrew from a news conference appearance on Friday but in a Twitter post said, ""It's a difficult time and I am not in control over a lot of what is being said and done.

GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, Germany, June 28 (Reuters) - Climate activists reacted with dismay on Tuesday to a decision by G7 leaders, prompted partly by the energy crisis resulting from the war in Ukraine, to grant a host of stays and exceptions to climate protection goals they had previously set themselves.

They also dropped a commitment to making half of all vehicles zero-emission by 2030, following pressure from Japan, replacing it with a vaguer promise to ""significantly"" increase their sales, confirming an earlier Reuters report.

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs for the United Arab Emirates, Anwar Gargash, speaks at an event at Chatham House in London, Britain July 17, 2017. REUTERS/Neil Hall
DUBAI, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates is taking steps to de-escalate tensions with Iran as part of a policy choice towards diplomacy and away from confrontation, a UAE senior official said on Monday.
Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE president, said the Gulf state remains deeply concerned about Iran's behaviour in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon.
""Despite this we have taken steps to de-escalate tensions as we have no interest in a confrontation. The whole region would pay the price of such a confrontation for decades to come,"" Gargash told the Abu Dhabi Strategic Debate.
""I am realistic about the chances of success. It will be a slow process, but we hope that over time we can build together greater confidence between us and start to make progress towards a more sustainable and mutually beneficial status quo,"" he said.

DUBAI, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates is taking steps to de-escalate tensions with Iran as part of a policy choice towards diplomacy and away from confrontation, a UAE senior official said on Monday.
Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE president, said the Gulf state remains deeply concerned about Iran's behaviour in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon.
""Despite this we have taken steps to de-escalate tensions as we have no interest in a confrontation. The whole region would pay the price of such a confrontation for decades to come,"" Gargash told the Abu Dhabi Strategic Debate.
""I am realistic about the chances of success. It will be a slow process, but we hope that over time we can build together greater confidence between us and start to make progress towards a more sustainable and mutually beneficial status quo,"" he said.

* Oct concentrate imports 1.8 mln T as miners, smelters negotiate
* Aluminium exports at 479,599 T
BEIJING, Nov 7 (Reuters) - China’s copper imports in October rose for a second month, customs data showed on Sunday, as traders took advantage of a short period of favourable pricing to bring in bonded inventories of the metal.
Arrivals of unwrought copper and products into top copper consumer China were 410,541.3 tonnes last month, the General Administration of Customs said. That was up from 406,015.6 tonnes in September but down 33.6% from a year earlier.
Imports in the first 10 months of 2021 were down 21% year-on-year at 4.43 million tonnes.
Activity in China’s manufacturing sector, a key source of copper demand, contracted more than expected in October amid curbs on electricity usage and persistently high raw material prices.
London copper rose 6.3% in October, outpacing a roughly 4% jump in Shanghai prices and making foreign metal more expensive, although a brief widening in the price spread in late September made imports favourable.

JOHANNESBURG, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Mourners held a candlelight prayer ceremony outside the Soweto home of late Archbishop Desmond Tutu on Wednesday, weeping over the memory not only of a world-renowned lion of the anti-apartheid movement but of a kind and loyal neighbour.
Tutu, who died at 90 on Sunday, lived for a while on the same township street as his longtime friend Nelson Mandela, where residents take pride in being the only people in the world to grow up with two Nobel Peace Prize winners for neighbours.
""Come December time, Father Tutu and Mom Tutu used to bring groceries for all the grannies here. He used to look after the elders. So losing someone like him is painful. We're filled with tears,"" Nkele Tshakela told mourners standing alongside the street.
Usually abuzz with tourists drawn to its vibrant culture and history as a battleground during white minority rule, Vilakazi Street had a sombre mood as mourners laid flowers outside Tutu's home and sang gospel hymns. Bishops and deans of the Anglican Church and Johannesburg Mayor Mpho Phalatse lit candles.

611,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The last orders bell tolled for Bud, Carlsberg and Heineken beers in Russia in early March, but shops across Moscow are still selling off stockpiles months after the brewers said they would halt production.
The continued availability of unsold stacks of Carlsberg, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken’s flagship brands underlines the difficulty Western brands have faced in withdrawing products in response to the conflict in Ukraine.
Their cans and bottles were still on sale in supermarkets and stores in Russia’s capital this week, a Reuters review found - an example of how long it can take consumer-focused sanctions or restrictions to have a significant impact.
It was not clear how much inventory Russian retailers have, but for now the supplies are helping to cushion the blow of the tough sanctions which prompted the world’s top brewers to turn off the taps to Russia’s most popular Western beers.
Carlsberg and Heineken said on March 9 they would stop production and sales of their flagship brands in Russia, joining an exodus of foreign companies after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, in what it calls its “special military operation”.
Two days later, AB InBev, which runs its Russia operations in a joint venture with Turkish brewer Anadolu Efes, said it had requested that the licence for production and sale of Bud in Russia be suspended.
Dates printed on the bottom of cans and bottles on sale in about half a dozen supermarkets in Moscow, including ones owned by the country’s biggest food retailer X5 and convenience chain Krasnoe & beloe (K&B), show that some production of all three beers continued in Russia after the brewers’ public announcements, in Carlsberg’s case for several weeks.
X5 did not comment and K&B did not respond.
Reuters identified Heineken cans with markings saying they were produced at a factory in St Petersburg on March 23 and Carlsberg cans on April 29 in Tula, a city south of Moscow.
Heineken said it sold out its own stock entirely soon after announcing that it would stop brewing Heineken in Russia.
“Our last brew of Heineken in Russia was in March, last packaging beginning of April and last sale second week of April,” the company said in emailed comments. “After that there was no Heineken being brewed or sold by Heineken in Russia.”
On March 28, Heineken announced its decision to leave Russia, seeking an orderly transfer of its business to a new owner and expecting to book related charges of around 400 million euros ($405.8 million), while guaranteeing the salaries of its 1,800 employees in Russia until the end of the year.
NOT YET SOLD OUT
Also on March 28, Carlsberg, the Western brewer most exposed to Russia, said it would seek a full disposal of its Russia business which would result in a “substantial non-cash impairment charge” this year.
The company holds a 27% share of the local market through its ownership of the country’s biggest brewer, Baltika, and employs 8,400 people.
The brewer said it had “limited production” after March 9 using materials already produced and to fulfil obligations to customers.
Last production was in April, and it had since got rid of its remaining materials, the company added.
“Carlsberg will disappear from the shelves in Russia as stocks are being sold out,” it said in an email.
Reuters found cans of Bud with markings saying they had been produced in the Volga city of Ulyanovsk in late June.
AB InBev in April said it expected to take a $1.1 billion charge as a result of its plan to sell its non-controlling interest in the AB InBev Efes joint venture, with the suspension of the licence for production and sale of Bud in Russia also part of a future transaction.

613,"""We fear no one:"" Ukrainians raise flags to defy Russia invasion fear
KYIV, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Ukrainians raised national flags and played the country's anthem on Wednesday to show unity against fears of a Russian invasion that Western powers have said could be imminent.
The yellow and blue banner fluttered outside schools, hospitals and many shops to mark ""Unity Day,"" a holiday President Volodymyr Zelenskiy created this week after Russia massed troops near Ukraine's borders.
Russia has denied it will invade, but has warned it could take unspecified ""military-technical"" action if its security demands, including restrictions on NATO, are not met.
On Kyiv's main Khreshchatyk boulevard, where flags decorated government offices, it was business as usual for many.
""Just a normal day, but these flags are here for a purpose, to show we fear no one. They did not scare us,"" said Mykola, who operates a small coffee stand in the capital.
A loudspeaker at a local government office blared patriotic songs, while television and government Youtube channels broadcast speeches and rousing reminders of Ukraine's nationhood.
""Everyone wants to scare us and we are here to stay,"" said Ludmila, a pensioner, who wore a tiny Ukrainian flag in the lapel of her coat.
At Kyiv's Olympic stadium, dozens of people unfolded a 200 meter-long Ukrainian flag, waving it to the beat of patriotic music.
In a televised address, Zelenskiy said Ukrainians were united around a common desire ""to live in peace, happily, in a family, children with parents.""

""No one can love our home as we can. And only we, together, can protect our home,"" he said. Zelenskiy was later due to inspect military drills in Rivne and fly to the eastern Donbass region to meet with serving troops.
Zelenskiy, himself an active social media user, called on Ukrainians to post pictures and videos of the Ukrainian flag and add hashtags. On Instagram, users posted under #UnityDay.
""Today we have proved, that we Ukrainians are a united nation, united people,"" said Pavlo Horinov, a official with the state Institute of Family and Youth Policy., said this week the president had chosen Feb. 16 as the patriotic holiday partly ironically, in response to media reports an invasion could happed on Wednesday.

Signage is seen outside a Cineworld cinema in Manchester, Britain, October 4, 2020. REUTERS/Phil Noble
LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Debt-laden Cineworld (CINE.L) is running out of luck. A Canadian court ordered the London-listed cinema chain to pay C$1.23 billion ($957 million) to rival Cineplex (CGX.TO) as damages for abandoning a planned takeover in 2020. The good news: Cineworld plans to appeal, which might take another year, so it doesn’t expect to pay the damages soon.
A 27% slump in Cineworld shares on Wednesday morning suggests investors are understandably taking a grimmer view. The potential fine compares scarily to Cineworld’s newly shrunken market capitalisation of just $600 million. Worse, net debt as of June excluding leases and other add-ons stood at $4.6 billion, 2.6 times the 2022 EBITDA that analysts compiled by Refinitiv expect Cineworld to generate. The uncertainty of the Omicron variant means that EBITDA level may also come down. Hence the potential claim might be in excess of Cineworld’s ability to pay.

(Reuters) - Nearly 20 major law firms are preparing to coordinate their defenses as they contest an antitrust lawsuit in Illinois federal court alleging a group of top universities conspired to restrict financial aid to undergraduates.
Mayer Brown partner Britt Miller in Chicago, co-leader of the firm's antitrust practice and a lawyer for defendant Georgetown University, told U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly that the defense lawyers had discussed a joint filing seeking dismissal of the claims filed in January.
""We will be as efficient as possible and targeted,"" Miller said at a hearing earlier this week in the Northern District of Illinois federal court.
Miller did not immediately respond to a message on Friday seeking comment about the coordination among defense lawyers and their firms. Other leading defense advocates did not return similar messages.
Karen Lent, head of the antitrust practice at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, is defending Columbia University. Eric Mahr of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, co-head of the antitrust litigation group, is on the defense team for Massachusetts Institute of Technology. White & Case partner Mark Gidley, leader of the firm's antitrust group, is representing Vanderbilt University. Among the other schools sued are Yale University, Brown University and Northwestern University.
In all, the purported class action accuses 17 schools of participating ""in a price-fixing cartel that is designed to reduce or eliminate financial aid as a locus of competition."" The schools have denied any wrongdoing.
The defendant schools are members of the ""568 Presidents Group,"" an affiliation that says it ""works together in an effort to maintain a need-based financial aid system.""
A message seeking comment from the group on Friday was not immediately returned.
The complaint said more than 170,000 would-be class members, who were financial aid recipients, were overcharged hundreds of millions of dollars.

626,"Japan's Q1 growth forecast slashed on Omicron hit to consumption: Reuters poll

TOKYO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Japan's economic growth will likely grind to a near halt this quarter as coronavirus curbs and supply disruptions threaten to derail the country's economic recovery, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Monday.
The forecast was much lower than the robust expansion expected in January's projection in a sign of the heavy damage chip and parts shortages and the infectious Omicron variant are inflicting on the world's third-largest economy.
Another setback for the economy could put pressure on the government to do more to offset a surge in global energy prices and to support households ahead of upper house elections that must be held by the summer.
Japan's economy will grow an annualised 0.4% in the first quarter, down from a 4.5% expansion predicted last month, according to the median forecast of nearly 40 analysts in the poll, which was mostly carried out before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The economy grew an annualised 5.4% in the final months of last year, keeping the seasonally-adjusted real gross domestic product (GDP), sized around 541 trillion yen ($4.7 trillion), below the pre-pandemic level of late 2019.
The economic outlook has become more uncertain for Japan due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis and soaring energy and raw material prices, which are aggravated by a weaker yen.
The Japanese currency hit a near five-year low against the U.S. dollar in January, and has since hovered close to that level.
In a Feb. 15-25 poll, the largest risk to the country's economy over the coming year was expected to be from the emergence of new coronavirus variants, followed by faster than expected U.S. monetary policy tightening and supply chain disruptions.
""Private consumption has to normalise for the economy to recover,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
""Coronavirus trends continue to be the biggest risk for that not to happen.""
Economic growth is expected to pick up to an annualised 5.6% in the second quarter, which was better than last month's projection of 3.4% growth, according to the poll.
The poll also found the economy would grow 2.9% in fiscal 2022, starting in April, after an expected 2.5% expansion this fiscal year.
Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile fresh food prices, will rise 1.2% next fiscal year after a projected flat reading this fiscal year, the poll showed.
Three-quarters of 33 analysts who responded to a question about U.S. interest rate rises said multiple hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve in the coming 12 months would not have a serious impact on Japan's economy.

- Summary
- Populist PM faces united opposition for the first time
- Promises referendum on LGBT issues tied to 2022 election
- Anti-LGBT drive aims to rally core Catholic conservative camp
- Wider impact may be limited as inflation preoccupies many
KECSKEMET, Hungary, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Viktor Orban is casting himself as the defender of traditional Hungarian values against ""LGBT ideology"" for the 2022 election in which his party may be vulnerable for the first time to a newly united opposition.
Identity politics, especially a hardline anti-immgration line, and disarray among Orban's centrist and liberal-left rivals proved instrumental in the absolute majority won by his conservative nationalist Fidesz party in the 2018 election.
But with a border fence having relegated migrants to a secondary issue, and many Hungarians now preoccupied with bread-and-butter issues including soaring pandemic-driven inflation, the opposition has come together and is running just ahead of Fidesz in some polls.
To win again next year, the key for Orban will be getting all of Fidesz's faithful concentrated in smaller towns and villages back to the ballot box, with a referendum on ""LGBT propaganda"" likely on the same day as an added fillip. read more
Yet with inflation running at a 14-year high of 7.4%, Orban will also need some of the undecided voters whom he is targeting with large tax cuts for families, massive pension hikes, a 20% minimum wage rise and a fuel price cap.
""The role of the anti-LGBT campaign could be mainly to give another strong reason to existing Fidesz supporters to vote for this government, cementing the core camp in its convictions,"" said Andras Biro-Nagy, director of think tank Policy Solutions.
But, alluding to soaring prices amid a still omnipresent pandemic, he added: ""This campaign has its limits and I think in the coming months Fidesz will not succeed in elevating this topic to the most important theme occupying people's minds.""
The anti-LGBT campaign, which the European Union executive has deplored as discriminatory, escalated in June when the Fidesz-dominated parliament passed a law banning the use of materials seen as promoting homosexuality and gender change at schools, citing the need to protect children.
Blue government billboards then sprang up around the country trumpeting the question: ""Are you afraid your child could be exposed to sexual propaganda?""
Orban, nailing his electoral colours to gender and sexuality issues, told a Fidesz congress last month: ""We will not give up the right to defend our borders...We insist marriage in Hungary is between a man and a woman, a father is a man and a mother is a woman...and they should leave our children alone.""
In a pitch to the insular nationalism of Fidesz's popular base, Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told website Index.hu on Monday that LGBT rights groups ""have huge influence in Brussels"". Gulyas accused the European Commission of blackmailing Budapest over the release of EU economic recovery funds because of its June school legislation.
The Commission's approval of recovery funds for Hungary and Poland is stalled because the EU says it believes ruling parties in both countries are undermining the independence of courts, media and non-governmental organisations.
RESONATING WITH THE BASE
The government's publicity campaign has been splashed across print and online media, radio, television and billboards.
It featured in a government survey in which, according to officials, 97% of 1.423 million people who answered questions on issues from tax cuts to immigration welcomed the legislation limiting ""sexual propaganda"" targeting schoolchildren.
Orban, first elected in 2010, has used such ""national consultation"" surveys to underpin his populist grip on Hungary's political agenda and keep his electoral base engaged.
In the town of Kecskemet east of Budapest, the anti-LGBT campaign and promised referendum have resonated with tradition-minded residents, while alarming the local LGBT community.
""This is a really good thing ... because, really, are we supposed to educate our children to become homosexuals?"" said Jozsef Farkas, 69, who said he would vote for Fidesz again.
In the referendum, Hungarians will be asked whether they support the holding of sexual orientation workshops in schools without parental consent, and whether they believe gender reassignment procedures should be ""promoted"" among children.
They will also be asked whether media content that could affect sexual orientation should be shown to children without restrictions.
LGBT WORRIES
Eszter Fejes, 36, an LGBT activist in Kecskemet, said she had faced the campaign up close, bumping into a blue government poster next to the entrance into her apartment block every day.
""Obviously I started to think...about what my family is making of this, or me or this whole issue?"" she said.
""But I am more angry from the community standpoint: in general LGBT people are going down an invisible slide when it comes to public opinion...People who are a lot more vulnerable than me are getting into a difficult situation now.""
Fejes said she knows of gay people who do not come out in Kecskemet but rather lead a double life, spending time in Budapest where anonymity is easier.
Over the past decade of Fidesz dominance, Orban has appealed to conservative Hungarians who believe their country is in a struggle to protect its Christian identity - from Muslim immigrants to so-called ""gender and LGBT ideology"" allegedly foisted on the central European country by Brussels.
But a recent survey by Policy Solutions found the high cost of living to be the No. 1 voter issue - for 47% of Hungarians - followed by low wages and inadequate public healthcare.
Even for Fidesz supporters, LGBT ""propaganda"" ranked only 10th as among the issues most troubling them, with migration higher up among the top concerns at 17%.

""The role of the anti-LGBT campaign could be mainly to give another strong reason to existing Fidesz supporters to vote for this government, cementing the core camp in its convictions,"" said Andras Biro-Nagy, director of think tank Policy Solutions.
But, alluding to soaring prices amid a still omnipresent pandemic, he added: ""This campaign has its limits and I think in the coming months Fidesz will not succeed in elevating this topic to the most important theme occupying people's minds.""
The anti-LGBT campaign, which the European Union executive has deplored as discriminatory, escalated in June when the Fidesz-dominated parliament passed a law banning the use of materials seen as promoting homosexuality and gender change at schools, citing the need to protect children.
Blue government billboards then sprang up around the country trumpeting the question: ""Are you afraid your child could be exposed to sexual propaganda?""
Orban, nailing his electoral colours to gender and sexuality issues, told a Fidesz congress last month: ""We will not give up the right to defend our borders...We insist marriage in Hungary is between a man and a woman, a father is a man and a mother is a woman...and they should leave our children alone.""
In a pitch to the insular nationalism of Fidesz's popular base, Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told website Index.hu on Monday that LGBT rights groups ""have huge influence in Brussels"". Gulyas accused the European Commission of blackmailing Budapest over the release of EU economic recovery funds because of its June school legislation.
The Commission's approval of recovery funds for Hungary and Poland is stalled because the EU says it believes ruling parties in both countries are undermining the independence of courts, media and non-governmental organisations.
RESONATING WITH THE BASE
The government's publicity campaign has been splashed across print and online media, radio, television and billboards.
It featured in a government survey in which, according to officials, 97% of 1.423 million people who answered questions on issues from tax cuts to immigration welcomed the legislation limiting ""sexual propaganda"" targeting schoolchildren.
Orban, first elected in 2010, has used such ""national consultation"" surveys to underpin his populist grip on Hungary's political agenda and keep his electoral base engaged.
In the town of Kecskemet east of Budapest, the anti-LGBT campaign and promised referendum have resonated with tradition-minded residents, while alarming the local LGBT community.
""This is a really good thing... because, really, are we supposed to educate our children to become homosexuals?"" said Jozsef Farkas, 69, who said he would vote for Fidesz again.
In the referendum, Hungarians will be asked whether they support the holding of sexual orientation workshops in schools without parental consent, and whether they believe gender reassignment procedures should be ""promoted"" among children.
They will also be asked whether media content that could affect sexual orientation should be shown to children without restrictions.
LGBT WORRIES
Eszter Fejes, 36, an LGBT activist in Kecskemet, said she had faced the campaign up close, bumping into a blue government poster next to the entrance into her apartment block every day.
""Obviously I started to think...about what my family is making of this, or me or this whole issue?"" she said.
""But I am more angry from the community standpoint: in general LGBT people are going down an invisible slide when it comes to public opinion...People who are a lot more vulnerable than me are getting into a difficult situation now.""
Fejes said she knows of gay people who do not come out in Kecskemet but rather lead a double life, spending time in Budapest where anonymity is easier.
Over the past decade of Fidesz dominance, Orban has appealed to conservative Hungarians who believe their country is in a struggle to protect its Christian identity - from Muslim immigrants to so-called ""gender and LGBT ideology"" allegedly foisted on the central European country by Brussels.
But a recent survey by Policy Solutions found the high cost of living to be the No. 1 voter issue - for 47% of Hungarians - followed by low wages and inadequate public healthcare.
Even for Fidesz supporters, LGBT ""propaganda"" ranked only 10th as among the issues most troubling them, with migration higher up among the top concerns at 17%.
Fidesz swept to re-election in 2014 with 45% of votes cast on party lists and scored a two-thirds majority again in 2018.

They also urged the tech giants to suspend the official accounts of Russian and Belarusian government institutions, state-controlled media and personal accounts of the countries' leadership and their associates that consistently disseminate disinformation about the situation in Ukraine.
The countries called on the companies to prevent Russian state-controlled media from circumventing restrictions imposed by several national regulators against them.
The online platforms should adjust their search and recommendation algorithms to inform users of disinformation and immediately demonetise all accounts controlled by the Russian and Belarusian governments, they said.

647,"Republicans capture Virginia governorship, dealing setback to Biden
FAIRFAX, Va., Nov 3 (Reuters) - Republicans won the Virginia governor's election and were within striking distance in New Jersey on Wednesday, a warning that President Joe Biden's Democrats are in trouble heading into next year's congressional elections..
Having never held elected office, Youngkin sold himself as a political outsider while seeking to rally suburban voters around hot-button issues such as how to handle the discussion of racism in schools and COVID-19 mask mandates.
In New Jersey's closer-than-expected governor race, Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli and incumbent Democrat Phil Murphy were locked in a virtual draw, even though registered Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by more than 1 million. Democrats clung to hope because more votes were due to be counted in their strongholds.
The results in two states that Biden won easily last year over Donald Trump represent a dire sign for Democrats heading into the 2022 midterms, which will decide control of the U.S. Congress – and with it, the future of Biden's policy agenda.
Polls leading up to Election Day showed that Youngkin closed the gap with McAuliffe by appealing to independent voters - a group alienated in 2020 by Trump's style of politics but more drawn to Youngkin's congenial manner - despite McAuliffe's attempts to link Youngkin to the former president.
""Comparing him to President Trump really didn't resonate with me,"" Jacob McMinn, a program manager at a defense contractor, said after casting his vote for the Republican in Fairfax, just outside Washington.
White women voters, who favored Biden over Trump by one point in 2020, preferred Youngkin by 57% to 43% over McAuliffe, according to NBC's exit polls.
Trump sought to claim credit for Youngkin's victory.
""I would like to thank my BASE for coming out in force and voting for Glenn Youngkin. Without you, he would not have been close to winning,"" he said in one of three statements about the race on Tuesday.
Youngkin, speaking in Chantilly, Virginia, early on Wednesday, called his victory ""a defining moment.""
""Together, we will change the trajectory of this commonwealth,"" he told the cheering crowd. ""And friends, we are going to start that transformation on Day 1.""

Youngkin will succeed Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat. Under Virginia state law, governors cannot serve consecutive terms. McAuliffe, 64, served as governor from 2014 to 2018.
The Republican candidates for lieutenant governor and state attorney general were also leading their races in Virginia, while Democrats were in a tough fight to keep control of the state House of Delegates after several Republican wins. The state Senate, which Democrats control, did not have a vote.

Murphy, 64, was seeking to become the first Democratic governor to win re-election in New Jersey in four decades.
He has overseen a shift to the left, including new taxes on millionaires, stricter rules on guns, a higher minimum wage and paid sick leave. He has also defended his robust approach to the coronavirus pandemic, including mandating masks in schools.
Ciattarelli, 59, a former state lawmaker, focused much of his campaign on the state's high taxes, while accusing Murphy, a wealthy former Goldman Sachs executive, of being out of touch.

648,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Nissan Motor Co Ltd on Tuesday rejected a shareholder proposal at its annual general meeting (AGM) that would have led to the disclosure of a decades-old agreement with 43% stakeholder Renault SA.
Ahead of the AGM, one investor proposed deeming Renault as Nissan’s parent company for disclosure purposes which by law would force the publication of the agreement which stipulates the automakers’ capital and business alliance.
Lack of publication prevents shareholders discussing the alliance which consequently remains “unequal”, the investor said. Nissan owns only a 15% non-voting stake in Renault.
Observers expected opposition from the French automaker to scupper the proposal. Still, Nissan last month said it would disclose the agreement’s content in its annual securities report to the extent it does not violate a confidentiality obligation.
Full disclosure of the Restated Alliance Master Agreement would reveal the scope of the 23-year-old tie-up, formed when Renault rescued Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy. The deal has long been the source of tension as it allows Renault to increase its involvement in Nissan’s management.
The alliance, which in 2016 added Japan’s Mitsubishi Motors Corp, was rocked by the 2018 ouster of alliance founder Carlos Ghosn amid a financial scandal. The automakers have since pledged to pool more resources and work closer to make electric vehicles (EVs).

Japanese auto supplier Sumitomo Electric Industries, which employs some 6,000 people in Ukraine to make wire harnesses, said it suspended operations at its factories there and was talking to clients about potentially substituting supplies from other places. read more
Ford Motor Co (F.N) has a 50% joint venture in Ford Sollers, which has three assembly plants in Russia according to the Ford website. Ford said in a statement it was ""deeply concerned"" about the situation and would ""manage any effects"" on its business in real time.
The U.S. automaker also said it would follow any laws on trade sanctions, but declined to discuss whether the Sollers plants have been affected.
While French car parts maker Valeo (VLOF.PA) said the direct impact on the company is minimal, the invasion could drag down industry production volumes, and hike energy or raw material prices.
For automakers, one of the supply-chain concerns created by the Ukraine conflict centers on the metals palladium, platinum and rhodium used in exhaust-scrubbing catalytic converters.

SHANGHAI, Jan 27 (Reuters) - China's financial regulators have met with the country's major bad loan companies to study how such asset management companies (AMCs) can participate in developers' asset disposals, the China Securities Journal reported on Thursday.

659,"Fed hawks say they want 75 basis point rate hike in July
The exterior of the Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building is seen in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 14, 2022. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger
July 14 (Reuters) - Two of the Federal Reserve's most hawkish policymakers on Thursday said they favored another 75-basis-point interest rate increase at the U.S. central bank's policy meeting this month, not the bigger rate hike traders had raced to price in after a report Wednesday showed inflation was accelerating.
The remarks from Fed Governor Christopher Waller and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard hit home, with markets swiftly reversing course to reflect the pair's preference, though still assigning about a 45% chance to a full percentage-point rate hike.
Waller, speaking at the Rocky Mountain Economic Summit in Victor, Idaho, said he would lean toward a larger hike if incoming data on retail sales or housing shows demand is not slowing fast enough to bring inflation down, or if inflation expectations worsened.
But, he said, ""markets may have gotten ahead of themselves a little bit yesterday.""
Despite the ""major league disappointment"" of this week's report showing inflation rose 9.1% in June from a year earlier, an ""ugly"" number was what he had expected, and only cemented his own view that a 75-basis point rate hike at the Fed's July 26-27 meeting would be appropriate.
""You don't want to, really, overdo the rate hikes,"" he said, noting that a three-quarters-percentage-point increase is still ""huge"" and shows the Fed is serious about bringing inflation back down to its 2% target.
""Don't say, because you are not going to 100, you are not doing your job,"" he said.
Bullard, in an interview with Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei released on Thursday, also said that he does not back a larger increase for now.
""So far, we've framed this mostly as 50 versus 75 at this meeting,"" Bullard said. ""I think 75 has a lot of virtue to it.""
Asked if the Fed's policy rate, currently in a range of 1.5-1.75%, could exceed 4% by year end, Bullard said: ""I suppose it's possible,"" but cautioned that would require data on inflation to continue coming in in ""an adverse way.""

661,"Saudi lobbying jeopardises UN Yemen war crimes probe, activists say
GENEVA, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has lobbied heavily against a Western resolution that would extend the mandate of U.N. investigators who have documented possible war crimes in Yemen, including by the Riyadh-led coalition, activists said on Wednesday.
The Saudi mission to the United Nations in Geneva did not immediately respond to a Reuters query about the allegations. The motion, brought by countries including the Netherlands and Canada, is due to be debated on Thursday in a session of the U.N. Human Rights Council.
Activists said the vote would be close and might depend on the number of abstentions at the 47-member state forum.
The Group of Eminent Experts, set up by the council in 2017, has found repeatedly that coalition air strikes and shelling as well as killings by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement during the seven-year conflict may amount to war crimes.
Afrah Nasser, Yemen researcher at U.S.-based group Human Rights Watch, said in a statement: ""Saudi Arabia, a leading party to the conflict in Yemen accused of serious violations including likely war crimes, together with its coalition allies, is engaging in a tireless lobbying campaign to deter states at the Human Rights Council from renewing the (inquiry) mandate.""
If the Council bows to Saudi pressure and fails to extend the mandate by two years, she said, it would be ""a stain on the credibility of the Council and a slap in the face to victims"".
A joint statement by the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies and Yemeni rights group Mwatana said a Saudi lobbying campaign seemed to be intensifying globally in a bid to dissolve support for the resolution and scuttle the investigators' group.

662,"* 2021 core earnings margin falls short of expectations
* Says facing high commodity prices in short term
* Q4 revenue rise 29.7%
* Shares fall 9% (Adds CEO comments, shares)
LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - British e-commerce company THG suffered another setback on Tuesday when it said its adjusted core earnings margin for 2021 would fall short of expectations due to adverse currency movements and remain under pressure because of high prices for commodities such as whey.
Shares in the company, which have not recovered since they slumped in October after a poorly received presentation, fell 9%.
THG, which has beauty and nutrition units as well as e-commerce services, said early 2022 was expected to be a more challenging comparable period due to global lockdowns in 2021 and record commodity prices, particularly whey, a core ingredient in its food supplement products.
Chief Executive Matthew Moulding said that despite challenging conditions, THG had scaled revenue and expanded its business model, particularly its THG Ingenuity platform, well ahead of expectations given at its IPO in 2020.
“The new year has started well, and we remain confident in delivering our strategic growth plans during 2022 and beyond,” he said.
He told analysts that there had been a rapid acceleration in the pricing of whey protein, with sweet whey protein doubling over the last year.
“We will sit and wait (to forward buy) because we do believe that the current pricing of raw materials are far too elevated and will reduce during the year,” he said.
THG said its 2021 core earnings margin would be 7.4% to 7.7%, compared to market expectations of about 7.9%, reflecting adverse currency movements.
It said it expected its margins to improve throughout 2022 as investments in automation offset inflationary pressures and the mix of revenues generated from its Ingenuity Commerce platform increased.
THG has traded at around 200 pence in recent months, far from its January 2021 high of 838 pence. The shares were trading at 168 pence by 1015 GMT on Tuesday.

That buildup was key to the fourth quarter’s hefty 6.9% annualized growth in gross domestic product, with inventory investment contributing 4.9 percentage points, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.
Spending shifted during the pandemic from services to goods, a boom that has strained supply chains and emptied warehouses. Excluding inventories, GDP grew at a more modest 1.9% rate in the latest period.

- Credit Suisse fined over corrupt Mozambique loans
- Swiss regulator said spying more widespread than thought
- Scandals reignite Swiss push for banking reform
ZURICH/FRANKFURT, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse misled authorities over spying on its staff and lied to investors about a corrupt loan to Mozambique, regulators said, painting a bleak picture of the cultural decay at the global bank.
The hefty fines announced late on Tuesday by British and U.S. regulators in the Mozambique case as well as a rare rebuke by Swiss regulators over the spying affair mark a low ebb for a Swiss bank that was once a pillar of the economy.
Credit Suisse, which brought in seasoned banker Antonio Horta-Osario as chairman in April to stop the rot, said in response that it condemned the spying and had taken ""decisive"" steps to improve its governance and strengthen compliance.

Nonetheless, the scandals, coupled with heavy losses from the collapse of U.S. family office Archegos and the hit to the bank's clients from the demise of British financier Greensill, have prompted debate about strengthening Swiss banking controls.
""The scandals expose a cultural problem,"" said Gerhard Andrey, a Green Party lawmaker in Switzerland's parliament who is pushing for tighter regulation. ""We need more power to tackle the top ranks of management at these banks, who always walk away unscathed from such scandals.""
Vincent Kaufmann, chief executive of Swiss investment adviser Ethos, called on Wednesday on Credit Suisse to claw back bonuses paid to managers involved in the various scandals and consider taking legal action against them.
On Tuesday, Credit Suisse was penalised $547 million by British and U.S. regulators for secret loans to Mozambique, whose discovery prompted donors to withdraw support for the southern African country and triggered its economic collapse.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said Credit Suisse had hidden the true nature of the loans, which were meant to pay for a tuna fishing fleet, including the payment of $200 million in kickbacks to its bankers and government officials in Mozambique.
""Credit Suisse, through its subsidiary in the United Kingdom, engaged in a global criminal conspiracy to defraud investors,"" U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in the DOJ statement.
The DOJ said Credit Suisse would have to pay British and U.S. regulators $475 million, after taking into account crediting and other resolutions.
Speaking for Mozambique's attorney general, Keith Oliver at law firm Peters & Peters said it was an ""important step towards obtaining full redress for the people of Mozambique"" and the country would bring those responsible to justice.

677,"Mali orders suspension of U.N. peacekeeping mission rotations
DAKAR, July 14 (Reuters) - Mali's military-led government said on Thursday it was temporarily suspending troop rotations by the U.N. peacekeeping mission MINUSMA, days after arresting 49 soldiers from Ivory Coast who it said had arrived in the country without permission.
Mali's ruling junta, which seized power in an August 2020 coup, has repeatedly butted heads with many of its traditional partners following sanctions and condemnation over election delays and its security cooperation with Russian mercenaries.
When the U.N. Security Council renewed MINUSMA's mandate last month, Malian authorities vowed to defy U.N. calls to allow freedom of movement for peacekeepers to investigate human rights abuses.
The suspension of troop rotations for the nearly 12,000-strong mission will remain in place until Malian officials can organise a meeting with MINUSMA representatives to discuss coordination between the two sides, Mali's foreign ministry said in a statement.
The United Nations called for an ""urgent settlement"" after the suspension was announced and said it was ready for immediate discussions to resolve the matter.

SEOUL, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) unveiled the latest versions of its flagship Galaxy S smartphones on Wednesday which feature enhanced camera functions and a faster processor chip, hoping the upgrade will revive sales after two weak years.
The S22 series will directly compete with Apple's iPhone 13 launched last September. Samsung's two-track premium mobile strategy has it launching flagship models in the first half of a year and Galaxy Z foldable phones in the second.
Aimed at appealing to consumers who are fussy about video and photo quality, Samsung said the S22 phones' camera offers clearer low light and night shots as well as automatic framing that can track up to 10 people, ensuring they are all in the frame and in focus.
The most expensive version, the S22 Ultra, comes with a stylus - a signature feature of Samsung's large-screen Galaxy Note model which many fans and analysts now believe to be discontinued.
While Samsung saw sales of smartphones drop off during the pandemic, arch-rival Apple logged sales gains.

The most expensive version, the S22 Ultra, comes with a stylus - a signature feature of Samsung's large-screen Galaxy Note model which many fans and analysts now believe to be discontinued.
While Samsung saw sales of smartphones drop off during the pandemic, arch-rival Apple logged sales gains.

683,"Known as “the Black QB”, Vick is returning to the field after his retirement from the NFL. He was drafted first overall in the 2001 NFL Draft and led the NCAA in passing efficiency in 1999. While he was retired from the NFL, he was a prominent figure in Atlanta. In 2007, he pleaded guilty to charges of involvement in a dogfighting enterprise. He apologized for his actions and plans to play in the Fan Controlled Football league with Johnny Manziel and Terrell Owens.
Vick was the first black quarterback to be selected with the top pick in the 2001 NFL Draft
The selection of Michael Vick made history. He was the first black quarterback selected with the top pick in the NFL Draft. Vick was born in Virginia and attended Virginia Tech. The Washington Redskins, Carolina Panthers, and Jacksonville Jaguars were all within driving distance of his hometown. The Falcons were able to snare him in a deal that was less expensive than Elway’s and came together the night before the draft. However, despite the lackluster contract and low draft stock, the draft was a rousing success and the Chargers and Falcons were thrilled with their new quarterback.
The success of Vick’s career started at a very young age, as a student at Virginia Tech. He regrets not taking his studies seriously as a freshman, but he did not let this deter him from pursuing his education. In fact, he often encouraged his peers to stay focused on their studies and to stay focused. The young Michael Vick grew up in a poor neighborhood in Newport News.
He led the NCAA in passing efficiency in 1999
Michael Vick’s remarkable college career was crowned by the media in 1999 after he led the NCAA in passing efficiency. His 180.4 completion percentage was the best of any freshman. In addition, he threw for 1840 yards and 12 touchdowns while rushing for another 580 yards and eight touchdowns. In 1999, he finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting. Before that season, a freshman had never won the prize.
As a freshman, Vick led the NCAA in passing efficiency and was a Heisman Trophy finalist. In addition, he led Virginia Tech to an undefeated season. His incredible performance led him to the national championship game, where he threw for 322 yards and two touchdowns. Though his team lost, the stout performance of Vick has rewritten the rules of college football.
He retired in 2016
Michael Vick is the latest player to sign with the Futures Collegiate Football League (FCFL). The former quarterback left the NFL in 2017. He had a record-setting year as a freshman, passing for 22,464 yards and 133 touchdowns. He also became well known for his trailblazing running style, finishing his career with 6,109 rushing yards. Vick’s return to the field will come on May 28, and fans will be expecting a packed stadium.
Vick served a prison sentence in 2007 and later pleaded guilty to federal and state dogfighting charges. After being released, he signed with the Philadelphia Eagles and played for five years with the team. His greatest season came in 2010, and he earned his fourth Pro Bowl selection. He subsequently played for the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Jets before retiring at the end of 2017. He has since been a coaching intern and analyst for Fox Sports.

May 25 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Wednesday, lifted by resource-linked stocks and banks, with investors watching for updates from central banks on monetary policy tightening amid rising concerns of an economic slowdown.

687,"UK PM Johnson says Ukraine peace talks are doomed because of ""crocodile"" Putin
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson records an address at Downing Street after he chaired an emergency Cobra meeting to discuss the UK response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in London, Britain February 24, 2022. Jeff J Mitchell/Pool via REUTERS
AHMEDABAD, India April 20 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said any peace talks over Ukraine are likely to fail, as he compared holding talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiating with a crocodile.
Johnson said dealing with Putin was like ""a crocodile when it's got your leg in its jaws"" and said it was vital that the West continues arming Ukraine.
The prime minister was speaking as he headed to India, where he will encourage his counterpart Narendra Modi to end its neutrality over the war in Ukraine. He played down the likelihood that India would end its longstanding ties with Russia.
""It is very hard to see how the Ukrainians can negotiate with Putin now given his manifest lack of good faith,"" Johnson told reporters. ""His strategy, which is evident, is to try engulf and capture as much of Ukraine as he can and perhaps to have some sort of negotiation from a position of strength.""
Johnson said world leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, agreed on a call this week that they would continue to supply Ukraine with weapons, including artillery, as Russia intensified its attacks on Ukraine's East.
Ukraine and Russia have not held face-to-face peace talks since March 29, and the atmosphere has soured over Ukrainian allegations that Russian troops carried out atrocities in the town of Bucha near Kyiv. Moscow has denied the claims.
Russia seized its first town in eastern Ukraine as part of a fresh assault this week that Ukrainian officials have described as the Battle of Donbas.
INDIAN NEUTRALITY
Johnson said the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had told him that he was confident of pushing Russian troops out of the eastern Donbas region, but that his forces were unlikely to recapture Crimea, which Russia seized eight years ago.
""The view of the president of Ukraine, if I understood him correctly, I speak to him a lot, is he would actually like Russian forces to be expelled from their existing positions in Donetsk and Luhansk. So that is a pretty maximalist position, but on Crimea they are not as maximalist,"" he said.
Putin has made it clear that he wants to take more Ukrainian territory and could launch a renewed assault on the country's capital, Kyiv, Johnson said.
""How can you negotiate with a crocodile when it's got your leg in its jaws? That's the difficulty that the Ukrainians face. We have just got to keep going with the strategy, keep supplying them with weapons,"" he said.
Johnson said when he meets Modi in New Delhi on Friday, he will encourage India to support Ukraine. But he accepted that India was likely to maintain its ties with Russia.
""I have already talked to Narendra Modi about Ukraine and actually the Indians have condemned what happened in Bucha,"" he said. ""But the UK in particular has to recognise that there is a historic relationship that India has with Russia. I think we have to be alive to that, and just point out where Putin is, I am afraid, letting Russia down badly.""

MOSCOW, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Two regions in eastern Ukraine where government and separatist forces have been fighting since 2014 were hit by more than 1,400 explosions on Friday, monitors for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said, pointing to a surge in shelling.
The two Russian-backed, self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions are at the centre of a surge in tensions between Moscow and the West over a vast Russian military buildup near Ukraine.
The OSCE's Special Monitoring Mission that is deployed in the conflict zone said it had logged 553 explosions in Donetsk.

MOSCOW, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Two regions in eastern Ukraine where government and separatist forces have been fighting since 2014 were hit by more than 1,400 explosions on Friday, monitors for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said, pointing to a surge in shelling.
The two Russian-backed, self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions are at the centre of a surge in tensions between Moscow and the West over a vast Russian military buildup near Ukraine.
The OSCE's Special Monitoring Mission that is deployed in the conflict zone said it had logged 553 explosions in Donetsk.

Jan 25 (Reuters) - 3M Co (MMM.N) said on Tuesday demand for its N95 respirators had picked up due to a surge in Omicron-related COVID-19 cases, while reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit as more people purchased its air filters and Scotch-branded products.
In December, the United States reported record high COVID-19 cases and hospitalisation rates caused by the more transmissible Omicron variant that spurred demand for 3M's respirators.
However, the company, which is the biggest maker of N95 respirators in the United States, anticipates that the demand will wane in 2022. It reported a 4% fall in its respirator sales for 2021.

692,"""It's tough here"": Mexican migrant town faces lure and lore of the American dream

IZUCAR DE MATAMOROS, Mexico, June 30 (Reuters) - In the small, sleepy town of Izucar de Matamoros in central Mexico, vendors sell pastries, sunglasses, and shoe polish under the hot sun for a few dollars a day. Those who want to earn more soon dream of the United States.
Chasing that dream, 53 migrants died this week after being trapped in a sweltering truck in San Antonio, Texas. Among those travelling were people from places like Izucar in Puebla state, one of the regions with the most emigration in the country.
""It's tough here in Mexico. There's violence, unemployment, health issues,"" said Izucar local Carlos Carrasco, who migrated to New Jersey in his youth and worked in a pizzeria. ""Everyone who goes to the U.S. goes in search of the American Dream.""
Sparked by comments from a local migrant advocacy group, Izucar was rumored to be the origin of two migrants who died in the Texan tragedy, which killed at least 27 Mexicans.
Puebla's government publicly acknowledged the possibility, but says it has no evidence to corroborate the Izucar link, with most of the victims yet to be formally identified.
Izucar residents say it is easy to believe there may have been locals in the truck, because despite the risks, the road north continues to lure young men especially, fed on tales of those who make it in the United States.
One local celebrity even funded construction of a mini replica of the New York Yankees stadium nearby with his U.S.-made fortune. So many people from Puebla have moved to New York that it has acquired the nickname ""Puebla York"" among them.
Locals say some villages have completely emptied out.
Jose Pablo Robles, another Izucar resident, said his nephew was caught trying to cross the U.S. border last month, and returned home with his feet rubbed raw.
""I think he'll try again,"" he said.
Adriana Gutierrez, a mother and homemaker, says several friends have made the journey, and that she has thought about it too.
""Here we don't have jobs, we don't have good wages,"" Gutierrez said. ""People go out of necessity.""
The region's exodus has now created a domino effect with the local population, said Izucar's mayor Irene Olea.
""The families that go tell their relatives when there's jobs, and they come,"" she said. ""And the children that stayed here go to look for their parents.""
The tragedy in Texas comes barely six months after at least 55 people died and dozens more were injured when another truck smuggling migrants crashed in southern Mexico. read more

- Toshiba says discussing separation plan with shareholders
TOKYO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Japan's Toshiba Corp (6502.T).
Some investors take issue with Toshiba's argument that a three-way split would create greater value than a private equity deal, given the company never formally solicited buyout bids, the people said. As such, some investors question the transparency of Toshiba's ongoing strategic review.
It would also be in line with the 6,000-6,500 yen range that some major shareholders including hedge fund Elliott Management have estimated as fair.
The Toshiba committee said last month it asked four private equity firms at what price a potential deal to go private could happen. The range of prices it received were ""not compelling relative to market expectations"" it said in a statement, without specifying the range or elaborating on market expectations.
Multiple sources have said the firms included KKR & Co and Bain Capital.
""We are communicating with shareholders explaining the separation plan we announced on Nov. 12 as well as listening to their opinions,"" Toshiba said in a statement to Reuters. ""We will continue our communications with various stakeholders.""
'BEST ALTERNATIVE'
The outside director who heads the committee, Paul Brough, told investors splitting Toshiba was ""the best alternative"", and the committee would not change its mind even if the price levels were made public, according to a transcript of a Nov. 15 meeting with investors seen by Reuters.
Asked by an investor whether shareholders could ""have a voice in the process,"" Brough said the committee hoped shareholders would agree the break-up offered greater value.
Reached via a Toshiba spokesperson, Brough confirmed his comments in the transcript but declined to comment further.
Some shareholders have also taken issue with Toshiba's decision not to pursue talks with Canada's Brookfield Asset Management (BAMa.TO), immediately respond to a request for comment.
Toshiba's review committee has said it held more than 25 meetings with an unnamed ""party"", but the suggested transaction was ultimately deemed as ""challenging"" for shareholders to support.

MOSCOW, Aug 1 (Reuters) - There is little Russia can do to help with urgent repairs required to malfunctioning Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline equipment, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday, following further falls in Gazprom production and exports.
Russia cut gas supplies via Nord Stream 1, its main gas pipeline to Europe, to just 20% of capacity last week, saying that a turbine sent to Canada for maintenance had not been returned and other equipment also needed repair. read more

704,"Fed scrambled to make sense of Trump's 2016 election, transcripts show
WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The election of Donald Trump threw Federal Reserve officials into a scramble to determine what it meant for the American economy, the world, and the U.S. central bank's own standing, according to transcripts of Fed meetings from 2016.
At the Fed's policy meeting a month after Trump's Nov. 8, 2016 victory, there were jokes about the unexpected outcome, warnings of the deep fissures it showed in the U.S. economy and the challenges it might pose to the central bank's independence.
""According to some interpretations of the Book of Revelations, when three unusual events occur together, they may be a sign that the apocalypse is near. Let's take stock,"" St. Louis Fed President James Bullard joked, referring to the final book in the Bible's New Testament and placing Trump's victory in a category with the Chicago Cubs long-awaited World Series victory that year and folk singer Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize.
""Does the recent election usher in a regime change with respect to growth prospects for the U.S. economy? The short answer to this is 'maybe,' and we are treating this as an upside risk,"" he said, according to one of the transcripts, which were released by the Fed on Friday.
Fed staff promptly tried to build best guesses about whether the Republican businessman would follow through with tax cuts and fiscal spending, tariffs on trading partners or new immigration rules.
The market reaction - a jump in stock prices - took some at the central bank by surprise, while others noted that their business contacts ""used words like 'exuberance' and 'euphoria,'"" because they expected lighter regulation and lower taxes, said Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed at the time.
The transcripts, which are released after a five-year lag, provide a window beyond the more scripted official statements of the day into how central bank policymakers grappled with a political event they understood from the outset could effect their work and potentially the Fed as an institution in fundamental ways.
FED INDEPENDENCE
Trump, even before his inauguration, showed an unorthodox approach to the presidency. His comments about federal contracts on Twitter, for example, slammed the stock prices of companies like Boeing.

709,"A month into war, communicator-in-chief Zelenskiy strives to keep eyes on Ukraine
- Summary
- Ukraine president proves a shrewd wartime communicator
- His job will get harder as conflict drags on, experts warn
- Zelenskiy has tightened his grip on domestic media
- His outreach at home and abroad has helped war effort
LONDON/LVIV, Ukraine, March 24 (Reuters) - The props were simple, the message was clear. In a video address to the nation this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy held up his smartphone to the camera and started a timer app while an air raid siren blared.
""It lasted 20 seconds,"" Zelenskiy said, after the wailing subsided. ""And we hear it for hours, days, weeks. Our people... instantly take their children, help the elderly, and go to the shelters... to survive, from Russian missiles, bombs.""
Sitting at his desk, unshaven and in his now trademark green shirt, Zelenskiy had in a few short sentences reminded 44 million Ukrainians that he was going through what they were, while renewing pressure on NATO to impose a no-fly zone.
While keeping the world engaged could get harder over time, for now that ability to communicate is making a difference.
His approval ratings at home have soared as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its second month, and he has rallied the nation around the flag as thousands of civilians take up arms.
Abroad he appears no less popular, as Western powers supply Ukraine with weapons and aid, take in millions of refugees and tighten sanctions around Russia.
For those who have worked closely with him, the 44-year-old's handling of the war so far is not totally surprising.
Iuliia Mendel, Zelenskiy's spokesperson during the first two years of his presidency from 2019-2021, told Reuters that the former actor put a lot of time and effort into his speeches. He is also quick to adapt.
""Now he can just take his telephone and make a selfie video, not caring much about the lighting and how he looks and that he has not shaved probably,"" she said.
The more informal setting brought him closer to people, ""because when everybody is suffering so much it would be really strange if... he tries to look official.""
Zelenskiy would often come up with a specific message or metaphor that he wanted to include in his addresses, according to Mendel, and looked for what would resonate most with a particular audience.
And so, as he hones his role as the face of Ukraine's resistance, he has used a mix of social media savvy, impassioned speeches and a virtual ""tour"" of the world's parliaments to try to prevent international outrage at Moscow from dissipating.
""He'll be aware that the world moves on. The world gets tired,"" Alastair Campbell, who was spokesman to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, told Reuters.
""He knows that you've got to keep finding new ways to keep this thing right at the centre of the global public debate and on his terms. And I think that's what he's done very well so far, but it gets harder the longer you go on.""
TIGHTENING CONTROL
As the war drags on, Zelenskiy is tightening his control over messaging at home.
Under martial law, his security and defence council temporarily banned Russia-friendly political parties, one of which holds a sizeable number of seats in parliament and which has in the past accused him of silencing the opposition.
He has also effectively shut down private TV channels by unifying coverage around one state station.
Ukraine has had a varied media scene, although major TV channels were owned by business groups that promoted competing political interests.
Zelenskiy faced some criticism from political opponents before the war for imposing sanctions on TV channels connected to opposition figures.
Now the unified TV news platform broadcasts speeches and interviews by Zelenskiy, selected state officials and regional mayors who address the plight of cities under Russian attack.
One of his main modes of communication abroad has been to address national parliaments, from Washington to Tokyo, via video link from Kyiv.
Zelenskiy's message has sometimes been blunt.
In his address to the U.S. Congress, Zelenskiy played a video showing Russian bombs falling on Ukraine, grieving families, bloodied children on hospital beds and corpses on the streets and laid into graves.
Zelenskiy then singled out U.S. President Joe Biden: ""You are the leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.""
His demand that NATO members impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine has been dismissed by some diplomats as impractical, because they say it risks dragging the alliance into direct confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia.
When addressing Israel's Knesset, Zelenskiy, who is Jewish and lost family members in the Holocaust, compared Russia's war to Nazi Germany's killings of Jews while asking Israel for its Iron Dome defence system to protect Ukrainian cities.
The reference sparked a backlash and the Israeli government did not accede to Ukraine's request. read more
On the eve of the one-month anniversary an impassioned Zelenskiy - speaking, unusually, in English - used his nightly video to bypass the world's political leaders and appeal directly to their people.
Casting the war as an existential battle not only for Ukraine but for Europe, he urged them to protest what he called Moscow's ""war against freedom"".
'SPEAKING FROM THE HEART'
For Campbell, Zelenskiy's ""sense of authenticity"" makes him an effective communicator.
""You really feel this is a guy who is speaking from the heart all the time, but without being too emotional,"" he said.
The president invoked playwright William Shakespeare and speeches of World War Two leader Winston Churchill while speaking to British lawmakers and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr while addressing the U.S. Congress.
Addressing the Japanese National Diet on Wednesday, he referred to Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear disaster and the prospect of Russia waging chemical warfare – resonant in Japan which suffered the Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995 and the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.
A former comedian who once played a fictional president in a popular TV series before entering politics, Zelenskiy has suddenly been thrust into a very different role.
When Reuters first interviewed him as a candidate in 2019, it was backstage at a comedy competition he was compering. Three years on, he spoke to Reuters in March in a city under attack, protected by armed soldiers in rooms dotted with sandbags.
But some elements of his messaging have remained constant.

- Summary
- New JPMorgan protocols effective Tuesday
- JPMorgan relaxes mask requirements for vaccinated staff
- Move follows New York State mask mandate
- JPMorgan urges staff to get vaccinated, have boosters
NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) instructed unvaccinated staff in Manhattan to work from home starting Tuesday, a further sign that banks and other financial firms are tightening protocols as COVID-19 infections rise and the Omicron variant spreads.
The U.S. bank, one of the most aggressive in bringing employees back to the office, previously allowed unvaccinated staff to work in its Manhattan offices provided they were tested twice a week.
In a memo to staff on Monday announcing the policy change, the bank urged unvaccinated staff to get vaccinated and for eligible employees to get booster shots. It also relaxed mask requirements for vaccinated staff working in its Manhattan offices.
""We continue to agree with health authorities that being vaccinated against COVID-19 is the best way to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe - especially as we face the winter months and a new variant - so please consider getting vaccinated if you aren't already, and getting your booster if you are,"" the memo said.
Most other banks already required staff to be vaccinated to enter their facilities. read more
Bank of America (BAC.N) has around 60% to 70% of staff back in the office, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said in an interview with CNBC Tuesday.
""We focused on getting our teammates safe and vaccinated and back to work when they were ready,"" he said. ""We didn't want people to operate in a hamstrung environment.""
U.S. financial firms have been more proactive than other industries in encouraging employees to return to offices. But the recent surge in cases has caused some to rethink their strategies. read more
Many companies are struggling with COVID precautions, given they can often prove divisive. Some are reluctant to ask staff to return to offices when measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing – which undermine the benefits of congregating in person – are still in place, consultants say.
""Having everybody vaccinated works — it prevents tragedies,"" said Andy Challenger, a senior vice president at outplacement and executive-coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
New York State's Department of Health issued a mask mandate effective Monday requiring any individual entering an office that does not require vaccination to wear a mask at all times.
""It seems unfair to require our vaccinated employees to wear masks all day at their desks, and would be a step that would slow the progress we've already made toward business normalcy,"" JPMorgan said in the memo.
More than 90% of JPMorgan staff based in Manhattan are vaccinated, according to the memo.
Vaccinated staff will now have to wear face coverings only when walking through lobbies, riding in elevators and in cafes when not eating.
The bank added that the memo does not apply to branch staff, who ""will continue to follow their established procedures and protocols.""
Other banks and financial firms have been taking steps to protect staff as infection and hospitalization rates increase in New York and other states.

""We continue to agree with health authorities that being vaccinated against COVID-19 is the best way to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe - especially as we face the winter months and a new variant - so please consider getting vaccinated if you aren't already, and getting your booster if you are,"" the memo said.
Most other banks already required staff to be vaccinated to enter their facilities. read more
Bank of America (BAC.N) has around 60% to 70% of staff back in the office, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said in an interview with CNBC Tuesday.
""We focused on getting our teammates safe and vaccinated and back to work when they were ready,"" he said. ""We didn't want people to operate in a hamstrung environment.""
U.S. financial firms have been more proactive than other industries in encouraging employees to return to offices. But the recent surge in cases has caused some to rethink their strategies. read more
Many companies are struggling with COVID precautions, given they can often prove divisive. Some are reluctant to ask staff to return to offices when measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing – which undermine the benefits of congregating in person – are still in place, consultants say.
""Having everybody vaccinated works — it prevents tragedies,"" said Andy Challenger, a senior vice president at outplacement and executive-coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
New York State's Department of Health issued a mask mandate effective Monday requiring any individual entering an office that does not require vaccination to wear a mask at all times.
""It seems unfair to require our vaccinated employees to wear masks all day at their desks, and would be a step that would slow the progress we've already made toward business normalcy,"" JPMorgan said in the memo.
More than 90% of JPMorgan staff based in Manhattan are vaccinated, according to the memo.
Vaccinated staff will now have to wear face coverings only when walking through lobbies, riding in elevators and in cafes when not eating.
The bank added that the memo does not apply to branch staff, who ""will continue to follow their established procedures and protocols.""
Other banks and financial firms have been taking steps to protect staff as infection and hospitalization rates increase in New York and other states.

713,"Backers of Trump election claims lose in Colorado Republican primaries

WASHINGTON, June 28 (Reuters) - Republican candidates who echoed former President Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen presidency were defeated in high-profile nominating contests in Colorado on Tuesday ahead of November's midterm elections.
The two Colorado candidates, U.S. Senate hopeful Ron Hanks and county clerk Tina Peters, who had sought the Republican nomination to be Colorado's top election official, are among dozens of Republicans who support Trump's denial of his 2020 election loss, prompting concerns that U.S. democracy could be at risk.
But Edison Research projected that Hanks would lose the Senate primary to businessman Joe O'Dea, who has rejected Trump's election fraud claims. Hanks took part in a march on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when it was attacked by Trump supporters seeking to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
Likewise, Edison projected that Peters, who has been indicted for election tampering and barred from overseeing voting in her home county this year, would lose the Colorado secretary of state primary to Pam Anderson, a former county clerk who has also dismissed Trump's baseless allegations.
Those defeats came on a day when a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack heard testimony from a former Trump White House aide that she had been told he tried to take control of his presidential limousine that day when his security detail declined to take him to the Capitol where his supporters were rioting. read more
Trump acolytes prevailed in other elections.

715,"U.S. lawmakers call for sanctions against Israel's NSO, other spyware firms
WASHINGTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - A group of U.S. lawmakers is asking the Treasury Department and State Department to sanction Israeli spyware firm NSO Group and three other foreign surveillance companies they say helped authoritarian governments commit human rights abuses.
Their letter sent late Tuesday also asks for sanctions on top executives at NSO, the United Arab Emirates cybersecurity company DarkMatter, and European online bulk surveillance companies Nexa Technologies and Trovicor.
The lawmakers asked for Global Magnitsky sanctions, which punishes those who are accused of enabling human rights abuses by freezing bank accounts and banning travel to the United States.
The letter was signed by the Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and 16 other Democratic lawmakers. Along with other reporting on the industry, they cite a recent Reuters article this month showing that NSO spyware was used against State Department employees in Uganda.
The lawmakers said the spyware industry relies on U.S. investment and banks. ""To meaningfully punish them and send a clear signal to the surveillance technology industry, the U.S. government should deploy financial sanctions,"" they wrote.
Trovicor wrote back to Wyden, denying that it engaged in bulk surveillance and suggesting that his office had confused its work with that of another company.
""Trovicor's products are not 'spyware' and are designed to be used for targeted investigations against identified individuals (as opposed to 'Bulk' surveillance),"" it wrote.
DarkMatter could not be reached for comment, while NSO and Nexa did not respond to questions.
The letter says the companies facilitated the ""disappearance, torture and murder of human rights activists and journalists."" Surveillance firms have drawn increasing scrutiny from Washington as a barrage of media reports have tied them to human rights abuses.
""These surveillance mercenaries sold their services to authoritarian regimes with long records of human rights abuses, giving vast spying powers to tyrants,"" Wyden told Reuters. ""Predictably, those nations used surveillance tools to lock up, torture and murder reporters and human rights advocates. The Biden administration has the chance to turn off the spigot of American dollars and help put them out of business for good.""
Spokespeople for State and Treasury did not immediately respond to questions about the request.

718,"T.J. Maxx owner lowers profit, sales forecast as consumers cut spending
Aug 17 (Reuters) - TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N) cut its forecast for annual earnings and same-store sales after quarterly revenue missed estimates on Wednesday, as red-hot inflation forces Americans with lower incomes to slash spending on clothing and home goods.
Analysts had warned that lack of stimulus benefits, as was the case last year, would also hit discretionary spending, particularly hurting discount retailers such as TJX, Burlington Stores (BURL.N) and Ross Stores (ROST.O).

GORZOW WIELKOPOLSKI, Poland, July 25 (Reuters) - Construction sites, factory assembly lines and warehouses across central Europe are scrambling to fill vacancies after tens of thousands of Ukrainian men left their blue-collar jobs to return home after Russia invaded their country.
Ukrainian workers had flocked to central Europe in the past decade - drawn by higher wages and aided by an easing of visa requirements - filling jobs that weren't highly paid enough for local workers in construction, the automotive sector, and heavy industry.
Many of these workers have returned home to help the war effort since Russia invaded on February 24, abruptly worsening labour shortages in some of Europe's most industrialized economies.
Reuters spoke to 14 company executives, recruiters, industry bodies and economists in Poland and the Czech Republic who said the departure of Ukrainian workers was leading to rising costs and delays in manufacturing orders and construction work.
Before the Russian invasion, Ukrainians were the largest group of foreign workers in central Europe. Poland and the Czech Republic hosted Ukrainian workforces of around 600,000 and more than 200,000 respectively, according to industry trade groups.

Truckers and supporters continue to protest coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine mandates in front of Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, February 1, 2022. REUTERS/Blair Gable
OTTAWA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Truck drivers who have been blockading downtown Ottawa for six days on Wednesday said they had no intention of leaving the Canadian capital until the government scrapped COVID-19 vaccine mandates.
Despite increasing complaints from residents about noise, pollution and aggressive behavior from some truckers, Ottawa police have declined to end the protest, citing the risk of aggravating tensions.
The demonstration began as a move to force the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to drop a vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers. It has since turned into a more populist anti-Trudeau movement.
""We understand your frustration ... but the responsibility for your inconvenience lies squarely on the shoulders of politicians,"" protest leader Chris Barber said in a statement to Ottawa residents.
""We are here and we are not going anywhere until we achieve our objective, to see an end of all COVID-19 mandates and with that a restoration of freedoms of all Canadians,"" he said.
Trudeau on Monday said Canadians were disgusted by the behavior of some protesters and vowed not to be intimidated.
The inaction of the police in Ottawa - some of whom have posed for selfies with demonstrators - contrasts with more robust action by authorities in the western province of Alberta.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Tuesday moved in on truckers blockading the U.S. border at the town of Coutts but pulled back after clashes with some drivers.
As well as paralyzing Ottawa, the protests are also threatening the future of the official opposition Conservative Party, the Liberals' main rival.

The inaction of the police in Ottawa - some of whom have posed for selfies with demonstrators - contrasts with more robust action by authorities in the western province of Alberta.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Tuesday moved in on truckers blockading the U.S. border at the town of Coutts but pulled back after clashes with some drivers.
As well as paralyzing Ottawa, the protests are also threatening the future of the official opposition Conservative Party, the Liberals' main rival.
Party leader Erin O'Toole faces a confidence vote on Wednesday from legislators unhappy that he did not support the protests more enthusiastically at first. "
725,"Carnival expects to cruise to core profit as strong demand blunts high costs
June 24 (Reuters) - Carnival Corp (CCL.N), (CCL.L) on Friday forecast a core profit for the current quarter, as the cruise operator returns to full operations even as decades-high inflation and surging fuel costs continue to bite.
Shares of the company, which have fallen 52% this year, were up about 10% as Carnival also said it expects bookings for the whole of 2023 to be at the top end of their historical range and to benefit from higher prices.
""Concerning the threat of global recession, while not recession-proof, our business has proven to be recession-resilient time and again,"" Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald said on a post-earnings call.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) removed its COVID-19 notice against cruise travel in March, almost two years after introducing a warning scale.
The CDC's move has been encouraging more people to travel on cruises, boosting bookings for companies like Carnival that now has a majority of its fleet back on water.
As of Friday, 91% of the company's capacity is in guest cruise operation as part of its ongoing return to service.
Carnival expects positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in the third quarter, compared with the negative $900 million it recorded in the second quarter. The company's EBITDA has been negative since the start of the pandemic.
However, it still expects a loss for the year as it faces a setback from inflation and surging fuel prices that has been aggravated due to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. read more

727,"Denmark pulls Mali troops out as junta takes swipe at France
COPENHAGEN/PARIS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Denmark will start pulling its troops out of Mali after the West African country's transitional junta government this week insisted on an immediate withdrawal, a blow to France as its counter-terrorism operations in the Sahel begins to unravel.
The decision comes amid tension between Mali and its international partners including regional bodies and the European Union that have sanctioned Mali after the junta failed to organise elections following two military coups.
Tensions have escalated also over allegations that transitional authorities have deployed private military contractors from the Russia-backed Wagner Group to Mali, which some EU countries have said was incompatible with their mission.
""We can see that the Malian transitional government, or the coup generals, last night sent out a public statement where they again reiterated that Denmark is not welcome in Mali, and we of course will not put up with that,"" Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod told reporters on Thursday. ""So therefore we have decided to withdraw our soldiers home.""
Denmark had sent 105 military personnel to Mali on Jan. 18 to join a European special forces mission, known as Takuba, that was set up to help Mali tackle Islamist militants. It said its troops had deployed after a ""clear invitation"" by Mali.
But the Malian government said this week it was surprised by the Danish presence, because a decision had yet to be made on a request from Denmark in June to deploy troops.
Denmark's withdrawal, which comes after Sweden affirmed earlier this month that it would leave Mali in March, is a headache for France, which had staked so much on ""Europeanising"" its Sahel intervention, where Paris has thousands of troops operating. read more

Johnson, who helped the Conservatives win a large majority in the 2019 election, faces a major rebellion among his lawmakers on Tuesday in a parliamentary vote on new COVID-19 restrictions.
That follows criticism over reported parties in his Downing Street office last year when such gatherings were banned during a coronavirus lockdown, questions over who funded a pricey refurbishment of his apartment, and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.

732,"Explainer: Killings expose special powers of Indian security forces
NEW DELHI, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Chief ministers of two Indian border states on Monday called for the withdrawal of a law that gives armed forces special powers to operate in some northeastern regions affected by insurgencies.
The push to repeal the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, known as the AFSPA, came after Indian security forces killed 13 civilians in Nagaland on Saturday in an apparent case of mistaken identity. read more
WHAT IS THE AFSPA?
Enacted by the Indian parliament in 1958, the AFSPA was initially drawn up to support armed forces trying to maintain order in any part of the northeastern states of Assam and Manipur designated as a ""disturbed area"".
By the late 1980s, the law was expanded to include seven northeastern states. The AFSPA remains operational in four states, including Nagaland, according to the home ministry.
A similar law is also in force in the disputed northern region of Jammu and Kashmir, where an armed insurgency against New Delhi has raged since the 1990s.
WHAT DOES THE AFSPA INCLUDE?
Once government authorities declare any part as a ""disturbed area"", the AFSPA permits armed forces personnel above a certain rank to use force after due warning ""even to the causing of death"".
The law allows the personnel to make arrests, including on the basis of reasonable suspicion, and enter and search any premises - both without warrant.
It includes a provision to destroy structures from which armed attacks are made or are likely to be made, or ones that can be utilised by potential offenders.
The AFSPA also provides protection to any personnel acting under its purview, stating that ""no prosecution, suit or other legal proceeding shall be instituted, except with the previous sanction of the central government.""
WHY IS THE LAW CONTROVERSIAL?
For years, human rights activists and groups have said that the AFSPA has led to human rights violations, while allowing members of the armed forces to operate with impunity.
""The Act has been at the heart of concerns about human rights violations in the region, such as arbitrary killings, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and enforced disappearances,"" the Hong Kong-based Asian Human Rights Commission said in 2011.

737,"Since the beginning of the livestreaming revolution, artists have gravitated towards familiar social media platforms and gradually made the leap to new online stages. Some artists, like Erykah Badu, even set up their own platforms to livestream concerts. As the format grew in popularity, venues, media organizations, and retailers began to do their own livestreams. The first livestreamed concert was held by American rapper Drake in early April, which reached nearly three million viewers and eventually racked up to 28 million views in a single day.
The advent of livestreaming has transformed how music fans discover live performances. In addition to changing how fans find bands and concerts, livestreams have shifted recommendations from local to global. Despite some pitfalls, livestreaming is paving the way for smaller artists to reach a global audience and improve their fan base. The rise of the Internet and smartphones has also helped to promote the growth of online video, which can make a big difference to the music industry.
The advent of livestreams has changed the music industry. Although there are still concerns about the safety of a livestreamed show, the technology is improving and has become more professional. This technology has improved the quality of livestreaming, and labels and events companies have invested in high-quality production. As a result, livestreams have become mainstream and a viable revenue stream for artists.
As the livestreaming boom ends, live gigs are expected to resume. In the meantime, it will be a lucrative source of income for musicians. As long as livestreaming remains a viable source of income, artists will be unlikely to turn their backs on it. And once they have the means, they may even want to keep on doing it. If the livestreaming boom continues, music fans will no longer have to worry about being caught unaware.

739,"Wall Street banks see four U.S. hikes in 2022, but inflation is a wild card
- Summary
- Companies
- Fed funds futures see 3.5 hikes in 2022
- Market pricing Fed terminal rate at 1.8%
- U.S. inflation could be nearing peak -analysts
- J.P.Morgan's Dimon -- would be surprised if only 4 hikes in 2022
NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Some of Wall Street's biggest banks now expect four U.S. interest increases this year starting in March, a more aggressive call than a week ago even as the situation remains fluid given the possibility that the supply shock to the economy could ease and consumer prices could stabilize.
Goldman Sachs (GS.N), J.P.Morgan (JPM.N), and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) all issued research notes forecasting that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy at least four times in 2022, more than a broad consensus from as recently as late December for three hikes.
Goldman also sees the Fed starting the process of reducing its more than $8 trillion balance sheet, or so-called ""quantitative tightening"" (QT) as soon as July.
J.P.Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC on Monday, meanwhile, he ""would be surprised if it's just four increases this year,"" adding that those four hikes ""would be very easy for the economy to absorb.""
In predicting the four rate increases, Deutsche, in a research note on Friday, said the U.S. economy showed more progress toward maximum employment. The German bank expects the Fed's balance sheet run-off to begin in the third quarter.
Some investors believe, however, that U.S. inflation may be nearing its peak.
""We are already seeing supply chain kinks ease, and all other things being equal even without the rate hikes, we are seeing inflation rolling over probably later this quarter,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago.
""We will still see probably white-knuckle numbers this week. This is about where we are expecting inflation to peak. What will happen is the natural cycle is going to help the Fed and whether they do three rate hikes or two this year, we just don't see inflation running that hot for that long.""
Easing supply chain issues were already evident in a U.S. manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management released last week.
U.S. manufacturing activity cooled in December amid slowing demand for goods, with supply constraints starting to ease and a measure of prices paid for inputs by factories falling by the most in a decade.
The ISM's index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 58.7 last month, the lowest level since January 2021, while the survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers tumbled to 68.2 last month, the lowest level since November 2020, from 82.4 in November. The 14.2-point plunge was the biggest since October 2011.
""The inflation data will remain elevated but there are indications that make it seem as if everything is somewhat peaking, even on the wage inflation side,"" said Jim Barnes, director of fixed income at Bryn Mawr Trust in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.
""The problem is we are not going to be able to confirm that for another month until we start getting some additional data that is a little more down the road.""

750,"The disappointing economic backdrop to China's policy dilemma
Aug 16 (Reuters) - China's central bank cut its interest rates on Monday for the second time this year, but analysts suspect it will do little to spur lending in an economy awash with cash but lacking in consumer demand and business confidence. read more
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) lowered the rate on its one-year and 7-day lending facilities by 10 basis points after a string of data for July painted a gloomier economic picture than previously.

China's retail sales grew 2.7% in July, compared with 3.1% in June, pointing to slowing consumer spending.
Industrial production also missed expectations. Concerns over fresh COVID-19 flare-ups, worries about jobs and the crisis in the property sector have dented borrowing by companies and consumers.

WASHINGTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden plans to nominate the No. 2 auto safety official to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the White House confirmed on Tuesday.
Steven Cliff, who has been deputy administrator since February, has been a key figure in the Biden administration's proposed rewrite of fuel economy standards through 2026.
Heis also overseeing the department's safety probe of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and investigation of whether 30 million vehicles produced by nearlytwo dozen automakers have unsafe air bags.
Reuters first reported Cliff's planned nomination earlier on Tuesday.
NHTSA later.""
The agency added Cummings was being named for a ""temporary assignment"" under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act Mobility Program. Cummings has previously expressed concerns about Tesla's Autopilot feature.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to her hiring on Twitter by writing: ""Objectively, her track record is extremely biased against Tesla.""
She responded to Musk on Twitter saying: ""happy to sit down and talk with you anytime.""
NHTSA, which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department, faces a backlog of pending auto safety regulations and has not had a Senate-confirmed administrator since January 2017. There has not even been a nominee for NHTSA's top job since 2019.
NHTSA in August proposed dramatically revising the Trump administration's rollback of Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules, proposing increasing fuel efficiency by 8% annually for the 2024-2026 model years.
Cliff, a former deputy executive officer at the California Air Resources Board, said the proposal reduces ""climate pollution by approximately the same amount as if we took more than 5 million of today’s vehicles off the road.""
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has seen a sustained increase in traffic deaths that NHTSA has ascribed to impaired driving, speeding, a failure to wear seatbelts and other unsafe behavior.
NHTSA last month estimated 8,730 people died in vehicle crashes in the first three months of 2021, compared with 7,900 deaths during the same period last year - up 10.5% despite a 2.1% drop in miles driven.

MILAN, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The highly contagious Omicron coronavirus variant is spreading rapidly in Italy, the National Health Institute (ISS) said on Thursday, releasing preliminary data of a flash-survey showing it accounted for 28% of cases on Dec. 20.
The previous survey showed Omicron at just 0.19% of cases on Dec. 6. read more
Comparison of the two reports shows the variant's doubling time is about two days, in line with the pattern already found in other European countries, ISS said.
""Although the results are still preliminary, the estimate confirms the great speed of diffusion of the variant, which is set to become dominant in a short period of time,"" ISS President Silvio Brusaferro said.
The data were provided in the morning to the government, which is expected to decide at a cabinet meeting later on Thursday on new measures to tackle the pandemic.
The analysis is based on about 2,000 swabs collected in 18 Italian regions and the final results will be published on Dec. 29, the ISS said, adding a new flash-survey would be carried out on Jan. 3.

756,"Judge blocks Arizona law recognizing 'personhood' at fertilization
Protesters hold banners during Abortion Rights Solidarity demonstration, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade decision that legalised abortion, outside the U.S. embassy in London, Britain July 9, 2022. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls
July 11 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday blocked a 2021 Arizona law recognizing the personhood of a fetus from the moment of fertilization, siding with abortion providers who said the measure was too vague and exposed them to prosecution.
The Center for Reproductive Rights, which argued on behalf of providers before U.S. District Judge Douglas Rayes last week, also said the provision could conflict with a state law set to take effect this year allowing abortion up to the 15th week of pregnancy.
A lawyer for the Arizona attorney general's office countered that the provision, which says state law must be interpreted to grant fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses the same ""rights, privileges and immunities available to other persons,"" was not intended to create any new abortion-related crime.
During the hearing, Rayes expressed concern about a state policy that the provision's effects be interpreted case by case in court, after providers voiced fears they could be prosecuted for child endangerment or other crimes.
Issuing a ruling on Monday, Rayes wrote that his motion blocking the law was not just about abortion. ""It is about giving people fair notice of what the law means so that they know in advance how to comply.""
He said the interpretation policy was ""so vague that it (makes) it impossible for plaintiffs to do their work with fair notice of conduct that is forbidden or required, in violation of their procedural due process rights.""
The case is one of many disputes over state abortion laws after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.

760,"Cuban peso in free fall against the dollar
HAVANA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The Cuban peso was trading at nearly 100 to the dollar on the informal market Tuesday, according to a trader and online trackers, a depreciation of more than 30% in less than a month and four times the fixed official rate.
The peso's free fall is bad news for a population that for two years has confronted a grave economic crisis and unusually severe shortages of food, medicine and other goods, a predicament made worse by the coronavirus pandemic and the Cold War-era U.S. embargo.
Local economists and business leaders attributed the recent depreciation to a growing perception that Cuba's economy continues to weaken, with runaway inflation, while the government appears unable to reverse the trend.
Independent online news outlet El Toque tracker, the most watched in the communist-run country, had the greenback trading for 97.50 pesos on Tuesday, compared to 72 when the year began.
The local electronic currency, called the MLC, which Cubans use on par with U.S. dollars to purchase goods in domestic specialty markets, was rising in tandem with the U.S. currency. It was trading on the informal market at 95.90 on Tuesday, the online trackers showed.
The peso and MLC have no value outside of Cuba. The government fixes the exchange rate, currently 25 to a dollar, but has stopped trading dollars and other exchangeable currencies because it says it has no cash.
""We have to deepen the political discussion with those who are increasing prices in the state and non-state sector,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel told a Communist Party meeting last week, blaming speculation and greed for rising prices.
Cuba's government late last year put annual inflation at 70%, but at least three economists consulted by Reuters say the rate is between 300% and 500%. Soaring prices have squeezed consumers already hard hit by economic crisis and the pandemic.

763,"Guatemala's Supreme Court suspends senior anti-corruption judge
GUATEMALA CITY, March 22 (Reuters) - Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice said on Tuesday it has suspended Judge Pablo Xitumul, who is known for his fight against corruption and handling high-profile cases against the military and former government officials.
The decision comes a day after the prominent Judge Erika Aifan resigned from the post and fled into exile to the United States, alleging persecution over her work as a renowned anti-corruption figure in the institution. read more
""This was an orchestrated plan to get judge Aifan and me out. I'm calm, we expected this and I am in Guatemala,"" Xitumul told Reuters by phone.
Xitumul and Aifan have both worked as judges in the country's so-called ""high risk"" courts, which were created after the CICIG, a United Nations-backed anti-corruption commission; and they both pushed for reforms to investigate organized crime and corruption.
CICIG was shuttered in 2019 under the government of former President Jimmy Morales who refused to renew its mandate, effectively kicking the organization out of the country.
Xitumul's suspension comes after a police officer filed a complaint against him stating he wanted to inspect his vehicle and he apparently objected, according to the document published by the Court. His suspension includes the right to salary while authorities investigate.
The judge told a local television station that the police stopped him for no reason.
In 2018, Xitumul sentenced former Vice President Roxana Baldetti to 15 years of prison for fraud, illicit association and mismanagement of public resources in the case known as ""Agua Magica.""
He also sentenced Efrain Rios Montt, former leader of Guatemala, to 80 years for genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013.
Throughout his career Xitumul also convicted multiple military officials for massacres that occurred at the time of Guatemala's civil war.

766,"Trump ex-adviser Bannon felt he was 'above the law,' prosecution tells jury
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - A federal prosecutor told jurors on Tuesday at Steve Bannon's criminal trial that the prominent former presidential adviser to Donald Trump decided he was ""above the law"" in defying a subpoena from the congressional committee investigating last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol.
The prosecution and defense delivered opening statements after jurors were selected in the trial, with the government's first witness then testifying. Evan Corcoran, a lawyer for Bannon, said in his opening statement that Bannon did not ignore the subpoena and in fact engaged with the committee in the belief that it would negotiate with his attorney and that its deadlines ""were not fixed - they were flexible.""
Bannon, 68, has pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanor counts of contempt of Congress brought after he declined last year to provide testimony or documents to the Democratic-led House of Representatives select committee. read more
The subpoena issued last September, prosecutor Amanda Vaughn told jurors, ""wasn't optional. It wasn't a request. And it wasn't an invitation. It was mandatory.""
""The defendant decided he was above the law,"" Vaughn added. ""That's why we're here today.""
Vaughn said the committee had reason to believe Bannon might have information about the events leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol and attacked police in a failed effort to block formal congressional certification of his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
Bannon ""didn't get stuck on a broken down Metro car,"" Vaughn said of the defendant's refusal to comply with the subpoena, referring to the Washington area's subway system. Instead, the case is about ""the defendant thumbing his nose"" at the normal process of government, Vaughn added.
Corcoran said that committee staff and lawyers for proposed witnesses almost always negotiate - and witnesses often appear at a date later than the one specified in a subpoena.
""That's the process,"" Corcoran said.

Amerling said the committee's authority expires at the end of 2022.

LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers have added extra drilling rigs much more slowly than during the recoveries that followed the last two oil price slumps, limiting output and helping push local prices to their highest level for seven years.
But the number of active rigs and total production are likely to climb next year as the recovery matures and producers unwind some of the disinvestment measures they employed to cut costs in 2020/21.
The active oil rig count was just 454 last week, according to oilfield services firm Baker Hughes, down from 683 immediately before the arrival of the first wave of the pandemic in March 2020.
The rig count is roughly half what it was the last time prices were near the same level in 2018, a sign of the pressure shale firms are under from investors to conserve cash and from OPEC+ not to encroach on market share.

773,"The farmers trying to restore life to America’s stressed soils as climate change bites
North Dakota rancher Gabe Brown is one of the leaders of the regenerative agriculture movement in the U.S.
- Summary
- General Mills, Unilever, PepsiCo and Nestle have pledged large-scale support for regenerative agriculture practices, which avoid the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers
- Of 900 million arable acres in the U.S., only about 1.5% is being farmed regeneratively
- High upfront costs, concerns about low yields, and difficulty in getting crop insurance are major barriers
September 13 - “Soils should look like black cottage cheese,” says North Dakota farmer Gabe Brown. Brown runs a 5,000-acre farm and ranch, but he is far from a typical midwestern farmer. A pioneer of the regenerative agriculture movement in the United States, Brown is on the road “280 days a year”, he tells me in a recent interview, doing talks, liaising with other farmers and stakeholders, and imparting what he knows to anyone who will listen.
Of which there are growing numbers. According to a new report by the non-profit Forum for the Future, the regenerative agriculture movement in the U.S. has “never had more momentum”.
General Mills, Unilever, PepsiCo and Nestle are among the major food companies pledging large-scale support for this type of farming, which emphasizes soil health, biodiversity and avoids the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. Amazon-owned Whole Foods called it the number one food trend in 2020.
Of those food conglomerates recognizing the value of more nature-based production, General Mills has been particularly vocal. It has pledged to advance regenerative agriculture on 1 million acres globally by 2030, an area that represents approximately 25-35% of its worldwide sourcing footprint.
So far, more than 200,000 acres are enrolled in programs they support, farmland located mostly in the Northern Plains, Southern Plains and Great Lakes regions of the United States and Canada, according to a spokesperson.
General Mills is a founding member of the non-profit Ecosystem Services Market Consortium (ESMC). It runs an Eco-Harvest market program, giving credits to wheat, oat, corn and dairy farmers in the U.S. and Canada for “improved ecosystem services” achieved through techniques such as using cover crops and reducing tillage.
Started in 2020 as a pilot with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, General Mills has now invested $3 million to scale up the program, which quantifies and verifies carbon, greenhouse gas and water outcomes on farms through independent third parties.
General Mills is also partnering with tech firm Regrow Agriculture to monitor 175 million acres of farmland via remote sensing in North America, Europe and South America. “A key to scaling regenerative agriculture across any region hinges on measurement,” says the spokesperson, adding that the partnership with Regrow will enable them to get a more accurate picture of the impact of regenerative practices and their net effect on emissions. Basically, they will be able to see if all of this is working.
In 2018, General Mills approached Brown’s consultancy, Understanding Ag, to help teach oat farmers in the Northern Plains region of the U.S. about regenerative practices. “General Mills does not buy directly from farmers. They buy from grain terminals,” says Brown. “But they saw the value and resiliency to their supply chains (that could result) if they educated farmers.”
It all sounds very altruistic, but what’s the true scale of this movement? According to Dr Kristine Nichols, a soil microbiologist and regenerative agriculture expert, of the 900 million arable acres in the U.S., only about 1.5% is being farmed regeneratively.
The Forum for the Future report says that there have been some positive shifts in the last few years, “around policy change, valuation of ecosystem services, alternative types of financial flows, demonstration of the business case and coalition-building amongst farmers”, but these shifts are still nascent.
Nichols and Brown both point to crop insurance as a major sticking point. If farmers want to receive crop insurance for something that happened in the growing season, they need to have followed certain rules, she says. “Meaning you had to have treated with an herbicide, or if you had a cover crop, you had to terminate that cover crop by a particular date; you had to have added the recommended amount of fertilizer.”
Whereas conventional agriculture is practiced in a very prescriptive way, regenerative is “almost limitless”, with regard to the cultivation and management options it might encompass, she explains.
Another barrier to the transition is upfront cost: seeds for cover or companion crops need to be bought, new harvesting or storage equipment procured, livestock potentially integrated. This same type of transition-centered investment is faced by farmers thinking about converting to organic.
In an attempt to overcome those barriers, a group of unlikely allies came together in 2018: the Practical Farmers of Iowa, Unilever, PepsiCo, Cargill and ADM. The non-profit and two food brands plus their suppliers began working together on a regenerative agriculture project after realizing there was overlap both in the region where they sourced soy and corn, respectively, and in their long-term sustainability goals.
In Iowa, as much as 90% of the land is devoted to agriculture, and many farmers produce both soy and corn. By implementing a regenerative agriculture program for farmers who provide crops for Unilever and PepsiCo – the former for use primarily in Hellmann’s mayonnaise – a certain amount of de-risking for those farmers can be achieved.
Herrish Patel, nutrition North America general manager at Unilever, says that part of the reason they’ve been able to scale the project up is because of this shared-cost approach, where not only farmers but a network of interested parties, all shoulder the financial risk. “It's a shared cost; you’ve got to believe in it and share that investment,” he says.
And the result? The more than 90,000 acres that were planted regeneratively in 2021 as part of the program meant a 27% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, according to PepsiCo.
Having such proof points is helpful in trying to affect change at a policy level, says Patel. It’s a reference to the U.S. Farm Bill, which is due to be updated next year, although he remains non-specific about what change exactly Unilever is pushing for. “It's too early to share. [But] we will continue to do what we're passionate about, and have a seat at the table and influence as much as we can.”
There are rumblings that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is alert to the need to adapt. Earlier this year it announced a plan to double the country’s cover crop plantings to 30 million acres by 2030 and its Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program, set out in February, “will provide up to $1 billion for pilot projects that create market opportunities for commodities produced using climate-smart practices”.
Across the border in Canada, the Trudeau government has recently announced increased funding to boost regenerative agriculture, with C$25 million ($192.77 million) earmarked for the cost-shared Resilient Agriculture Landscape Program. Although sustainable agriculture proponents, such as the coalition Farmers for Climate Solutions, had hoped for more, they said there were “many positive outcomes” from the proposed new agreement.

NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - AIG Inc's life insurance and retirement division Corebridge Financial Inc (CRBG.N) raised $1.68 billion on Wednesday in the biggest initial public offering (IPO) so far this year, braving market volatility and ending a seven-month lull in major listings.
AIG said it sold 80 million Corebridge shares at $21 per share, which was at the lower end of their indicated target range of $21 to $24 per share.
The IPO values Corebridge at $13.6 billion.
All proceeds of the IPO will go to AIG and the new company is not raising new capital, according to an earlier filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Corebridge's share sale could help shake the IPO market out of its hibernation. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and rampant inflation triggering rises in interest rates have been driving stock market volatility since February, making it hard for companies to press ahead with listings.
IPOs in the United States are on track for their worst year in over two decades, according to Dealogic, which tracks listing data going back to 1995. So far, companies have raised about $18 billion this year, compared to over $231 billion during the same period last year, according to the data provider.
Other companies, including social media platform Reddit and software firm ServiceTitan, have been forced to delay their IPO plans this year in light of the volatility.

781,"Scotiabank investors see Citi's Mexican unit as good fit, CEO downplays interest
TORONTO, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) (BNS.TO) shareholders are urging Canada's No. 3 lender to seriously examine the Mexican consumer banking unit being sold by Citigroup (C.N), arguing it would benefit from scaling up in the fast-growing Latin American country.
Markets view Scotiabank as a logical bidder even though Chief Executive Officer Brian Porter downplayed appetite for big deals just a day before Citi announced the sale of Citibanamex, the third biggest retail bank in Mexico.
Acquiring Citibanamex, estimated to be worth $4 billion to $8 billion, would help Scotiabank expand in Mexico, which accounted for nearly a quarter of its international business revenue in fiscal 2021, and 7.6% of total revenue. read more
""It's another opportunity to expand outside of Canada, which I'm in favour of,"" said Allan Small of Allan Small Financial Group with iA Private Wealth.
""If the assets are made available at the right price, I would not be surprised to see Scotiabank bid for them,"" Small added.
Scotiabank had about C$7.5 billion of excess capital at the end of 2021, but Porter said the bank is not considering acquisitions outside of U.S. wealth deals of less than C$900 million ($719 million).
""There aren't any big files on my desk in terms of buying somebody's stake in a Mexican bank or anything like that,"" Porter said last week at a conference.
A Scotiabank spokesperson declined to comment further.
Expansion in Mexico is not without risks. Scotiabank's international business, dominated by Mexico, Peru, Chile and Colombia, has disappointed recently as the pandemic hit some markets later and harder than at home.
And the business has historically accounted for most of its impaired loans and write-offs.
FASTER GROWTH
Still, it has helped Scotiabank outperform in other periods. Even in 2021, strength in Mexico and Chile helped offset weakness in the other two markets, and Porter expects them to continue leading growth this year.
With faster economic growth and interest rate increases than Canada, the unit is also expected to drive a recovery in net interest margins.
A deal ""would add significant incremental scale that could drive stronger bottom line results within Mexico,"" said Edward Jones Analyst James Shanahan.
Limited Canadian growth has driven major banks' overseas expansion for decades. They have redoubled their efforts after amassing billions of dollars of excess capital during the pandemic, with most focused on the United States. read more
That has raised some questions about overpaying. Amid concerns about the premium Bank of Montreal paid in its $16.3 billion purchase of BNP Paribas' U.S. unit last month, executives said it could extract greater efficiencies and better returns than smaller players.
Referring to an analyst estimate that Citi could seek as much $15 billion for Citibanamex, Kingwest & Co Portfolio Manager Anthony Visano said Scotiabank would require ""substantial equity financing"" to fund such a deal. But its presence in the same markets as Citi would help it achieve better synergies than BMO would in the U.S., and create Mexico's second-biggest lender by deposits, he said.
""Does it warrant a higher price on the surface? Possibly,"" he said. ""But they'd be right to be prudent. The key consideration is price.""

- Core capital goods orders increase 0.8% in September
- Shipments of core capital goods jump 1.4%
- Goods trade deficit widens 9.2%; inventories mixed
WASHINGTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased to a record high in September and shipments surged, pointing to strong business spending on equipment, though stretched supply chains likely hampered overall economic growth in the third quarter.
Slower growth expectations were reinforced by other data from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing the goods trade deficit widening sharply last month, with exports slumping. While wholesale inventories increased, stocks at retailers fell as supply at auto dealerships continued to decrease rapidly amid a global semiconductor shortage.
The reports, which came ahead of the government's snapshot of third-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, had some economists ratcheting down their growth estimates. The economy is believed to have expanded at the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2020, when it suffered a historic contraction in the wake of stringent mandatory measures to contain the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
""The third quarter may be the weakest quarter for economic growth in over a year, but you would never know it looking at business capital spending setting records this month,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Business is looking past the slowdown in consumer spending in the third quarter and betting consumers will return to the shops and malls later this year and clear the shelves.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.8% last month to an all-time high. These so-called core capital goods orders advanced 0.5% in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders gaining 0.5%.
There were increases in orders for machinery, primary metals and fabricated metals products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell as did those for computers and electronic products, likely because of the worldwide chip shortage.
Shipments of core capital goods shot up 1.4% last month after rising 0.6% in August. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.

The seal of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seen at their headquarters in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 12, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly
NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) late on Thursday approved the country's 17th stock exchange, a subsidiary of Boston-based BOX Exchange, which will incorporate blockchain technology.
The new exchange, named BSTX, aims to launch in the second quarter, said Jay Fraser, a director. It will initially trade securities, such as stocks or exchange-traded funds, first listed on its exchange, but those securities would be tradable on rival bourses.
BSTX ultimately aims to expand trading to all U.S. stocks and potentially tokenized securities, Fraser said. Stock tokens are digital versions of equities pegged to the underlying share, usually traded in fractional units.
Fraser said the aim is for BSTX to look ""more like"" crypto exchanges such as Coinbase (COIN.O) as opposed to traditional exchanges like Nasdaq (NDAQ.O).
In addition to traditional pricing data feeds, BSTX plans to offer a market data feed that will operate on a private blockchain. That feed will allow exchange members to see their own activity, as well as the activity of other BSTX participants on an anonymized, delayed basis, the exchange filing said.
The exchange plans to expand its use of blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, over time to support products like tokenized securities, Fraser said.
BSTX was originally going to be called the Boston Security Token Exchange and planned to exclusively trade tokenized securities, but the SEC rejected that plan in December of 2020.

- Companies
OSLO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Norwegian natural gas exports hit a record high of 128.4 billion crowns ($13.26 billion) in July as prices and demand in Europe surged amid disruption of Russian supplies, official data showed on Monday..
.
Norway, western Europe's largest oil and gas supplier, has adjusted its gas production to sell more gas for exports, instead of re-injecting it back into the ground to pump more oil.
""Europe continues to decarbonize (its energy sector), but the first thing that they want to get rid of is Russian gas,"" Norway's Climate Minister Espen Barth Eide told Reuters in an interview prior to the release of the export data.
The war in Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"", meant there will be more demand for Norwegian gas in Europe in the short run, but there will be less demand in the long run as Europe will need to catch up with its emission reduction targets.
July gas export revenues exceeded the previous record, set in March, by 14.3%, the statistics office said, adding that the value of Norwegian oil exports also rose 52.1% from a year ago to 48.7 billion crowns.
In addition, Norway in July exported 4.8 billion crowns worth of electricity via international cables, including to Britain and Germany.
Demand for exports and historically low levels of Norwegian hydropower plant reservoirs have pushed domestic power prices to record highs, prompting calls to restrict exports.

WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it was withdrawing proposed conditions that could have allowed delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to install a laser-based missile-defense on Airbus A321-200 airplanes.
The FAA said Tuesday it ""has determined that further internal study is necessary."" The FAA said to avoid confusion ""a comment period on a proposal that the agency is not moving forward at this time, the FAA is withdrawing the notice."" FedEx did not comment Tuesday and the FAA declined comment beyond the withdrawal.
The FAA had said on Friday it was proposing conditions and opening the proposal for public comment.
In October, 2019, FedEx applied for approval to use a feature that emits infrared laser energy outside the aircraft as a countermeasure against heat-seeking missiles, the FAA disclosed Friday.
For decades, the airline industry and several governments have been grappling with the threat to airliners from shoulder-fired missiles known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems, or MANPADs. Some use infrared systems to target an aircraft's engines.
""The FedEx missile-defense system directs infrared laser energy toward an incoming missile, in an effort to interrupt
the missile’s tracking of the aircraft’s heat,"" the FAA document said.
According to the U.S. State Department, more than 40 civil airplanes have been hit by MANPADs since the 1970s.
In November 2002, two missiles narrowly missed an Arkia Israeli Airlines Boeing 757 passenger jet on take-off from Mombasa airport, and efforts to combat the threat accelerated.

801,"Gas price windfall makes Gazprom patient over Nord Stream 2 delay
MOSCOW, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Windfall revenues from high European gas prices mean Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) will not start pumping gas through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline before certification and it will not press Germany to speed up the process, two sources said.
Pumping gas without the German approval would only incur a modest fine, but as Germany gets new political leadership and Russia's ties with the West are severely strained, a source at Gazprom said it was content to wait.
""We don't want to seek faster approval for the pipeline. Now it's Germany that is in charge,"" the source said on condition of anonymity.
The same source said that Gazprom, Russia's biggest tax payer, and the Kremlin were also keen to understand how ties with Germany's new government would evolve after the departure of Angela Merkel, who supported Nord Stream 2.
The Kremlin has said publicly it does not view as political the certification process, understands it is complex and that Russia must be patient.
The second source said Gazprom was ""feeling great"" and expected next year's gas market to remain as short of gas as it is now, keeping prices high. Gazprom's additional supplies were not yet onstream, the source said.
INFLATIONARY PRESSURES
Elevated electricity costs have forced some industries to curtail production and European consumers are paying more for home heating as winter approaches, adding to wider inflationary pressures.
The Russian gas export pipeline monopoly, which supplies 35% of European needs, says it is meeting contracted commitments - which top European clients have confirmed to Reuters.

802,"Spain sends warships to Black Sea, considers sending warplanes
MADRID, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Spain has sent warships to join NATO naval forces in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea as tension in the region rises over the Russian military build-up on the Ukrainian border, Defence Minister Margarita Robles said on Thursday.
A mine-sweeper is already en route and a frigate will sail within three or four days, Robles told reporters. The Madrid government is also considering sending fighter jets to Bulgaria, she said.
""Russia cannot tell any country what to do, so NATO will protect and defend the sovereignty of any country that can or wants to join NATO,"" she said.
Spain's preference was for an ""exclusively diplomatic response"" to resolving the conflict, she added.

MADRID, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Spain has sent warships to join NATO naval forces in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea as tension in the region rises over the Russian military build-up on the Ukrainian border, Defence Minister Margarita Robles said on Thursday.
A mine-sweeper is already en route and a frigate will sail within three or four days, Robles told reporters. The Madrid government is also considering sending fighter jets to Bulgaria, she said.
""Russia cannot tell any country what to do, so NATO will protect and defend the sovereignty of any country that can or wants to join NATO,"" she said.
Spain's preference was for an ""exclusively diplomatic response"" to resolving the conflict, she added.

804,"U.S. deputy special envoy for Iran leaves post amid Iran nuclear talks
State Department spokesman Ned Price speaks at the State Department in Washington, DC, U.S. August 18, 2021. Andrew Harnik/Pool via REUTERS
WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A senior member of the U.S. team negotiating with Iran has left the role amid a report of differences of opinion on the way forward, as the urgency to salvage the 2015 Iran nuclear deal intensifies.
A State Department official confirmed on Monday that Richard Nephew, U.S. Deputy Special Envoy for Iran, is no longer on the negotiating team, but was still a State Department employee. The official did not give a reason for the change but said personnel moves were 'very common' a year into an administration.
The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Nephew left after differences of opinion within the U.S. negotiating team on Iran. The paper said he had advocated a tougher posture in the current negotiations.
The departure comes at a critical time as the United States and its European allies last week said there were just weeks to salvage the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
Indirect talks between Iran and the United States resumed almost two months ago. Western diplomats have indicated they were hoping for a breakthrough over the next few weeks, but sharp differences remain..
The State Department official said the withdrawal of the Trump administration from the JCPOA had left the Biden administration with a crisis. Finding a way forward could lead to disagreements.
""Working our way out of this crisis requires many difficult, closely balanced decisions, on which there can be reasonable disagreement ... The senior-most levels of our Government have given careful consideration to these choices, weighed multiple views, and settled on a policy,"" the official said.

NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Sustainable fuel startup Air Company has multi-year agreements to sell jet fuel made from captured carbon emissions to carriers JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) and Britain's Virgin Atlantic, the companies said on Thursday.
Financial terms were not disclosed..
New York-based Air Company said it uses carbon dioxide from a variety of sources, such as ethanol plants, to make SAF.
The global aviation industry is under pressure to reduce carbon emissions and find ways to meet the 2050 net-zero emissions target set by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in 2021.

813,"China Evergrande's offshore debt, assets could be separated in restructuring - report
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The provincial government leading China Evergrande Group's restructuring wants to separate the company's offshore assets and sell them to pay off foreign debt, a media report said on Friday, in a boost to foreign lenders' hopes of recouping funds.
Financial intelligence provider REDD said on Friday the provincial government in Guangdong, where Evergrande is based, aimed to release a framework debt restructuring plan by March that could also wipe out the 60% stake of the group's chairman.
Citing two sources briefed on the matter, REDD said the provincial government was proposing that state-led investors should buy Evergrande <3333,HK> assets and that proceeds from the sale of foreign assets should be used to pay offshore debt.
While investors have been expecting state-led organisations to help smooth the restructuring, some have been concerned that Beijing would use proceeds from any asset sales to prioritise paying off onshore debt.
The provincial government has finalised the framework document and submitted it to China's cabinet for discussions late this week, REDD said, adding a detailed restructuring proposal would be released by October.
The provincial government, cabinet and Evergrande did not respond to requests for comment outside regular business hours.
Evergrande is the world's most-indebted property company with more than $300 billion in liabilities, including nearly $20 billion of international bonds all deemed to be in default after a run of missed payments late last year.
Evergrande's April 2023 U.S. dollar bond jumped to 17.762 cents on the dollar after the REDD report, data by Duration Finance showed, up from 12.227 overnight. Its shares closed down 0.6%, before the report was published.
The REDD report also said Evergrande Chairman Hui Ka Yan's 59.78% stake in the company could be wiped out after completion of the restructuring because the developer is ""significantly insolvent.""
Earlier on Friday, the developer said in a filing it was hiring more financial and legal advisers - China International Capital Corp Ltd, BOCI Asia Ltd and Zhong Lun Law Firm - to follow up with demands from creditors.
That came a day after an offshore creditor group, represented by law firm Kirkland & Ellis and investment bank Moelis, said it was ready to take ""enforcement actions"" to defend members' rights after what it said was Evergrande's lack of engagement. read more
Evergrande has asked offshore bondholders to disclose holdings, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Friday. The developer is seeking replies by mid-next week to identify investors for communications, to aid debt restructuring.

The new issue followed a report that the developer failed to attract demand for a potential $300 million convertible bond last Wednesday. IFR reported Country Garden tested the waters for a three-year deal which would carry a yield-to-maturity of 4.75% and a conversion premium of 25%.
Shares of Country Garden dropped nearly 3% to HK$6.76, while its January 2023 international bond rose to 97.825 from 92.787 overnight.

816,"Putin warns United States against supplying Ukraine longer range missiles
- Summary
- Companies
- Putin warns United States over missile supplies
- Russia will strike if longer range missiles supplied
- Russia cracking West's drones 'like nuts' - Putin
LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin warned the United States in an interview broadcast on Sunday that Russia would strike new targets if the West supplied longer-range missiles to Ukraine for use in high-precision mobile rocket systems.
The United States has ruled out sending its own or NATO forces to Ukraine but Washington and its European allies have supplied weapons to Kyiv such as drones, Howitzer heavy artillery, anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles.
President Joe Biden last week said Washington would supply Ukraine with M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, after he received assurances from Kyiv that it would not be used to target Russia. read more
Putin said the arms shipments were ""nothing new"" and changed nothing but cautioned that there would be a response if the United States supplied longer-range munitions for the HIMARS systems which have a maximum range of up to 300 km (185 miles) or more.
If longer-range missiles are supplied, ""we will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting,"" Putin told the Rossiya-1 state television channel in an interview.
Putin said the range of the Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) HIMARS systems depended on the munitions supplied and that the range announced by the United States was around the same as Soviet-made missile systems that Ukraine already had.
""This is nothing new. It doesn't change anything in essence,"" Putin said. He said the arms merely replaced those that Russia had destroyed.
Putin did not identify the targets Russia would strike, but said the ""fuss"" around Western arms supplies was designed to drag out the conflict.
The U.S. Department of Defense said it was supplying Ukraine four M142 HIMARS systems along with the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System that it said had a range of over 40 miles (64 km) - double the range of the howitzers it supplied.
'CRACKING NUTS'
The war in Ukraine, Europe's biggest ground invasion since World War Two, has shown the limits of Russia's post-Soviet military power with significant losses and several changes of strategy in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance.
Speaking about the drones delivered by Western states to Ukraine, Putin said Russian air defences were ""cracking them like nuts"". Dozens, he said, had been destroyed.
Although Russian officials have warned that the U.S. decision to supply Ukraine with advanced rocket systems would exacerbate the conflict, Putin said it would not bring on any fundamental changes on the battlefield.
The interview, which the Kremlin said was recorded on June 3 in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, showed Putin sitting before a large wall map of Russia, Europe and Central Asia.

824,"Analysis: A handbook of (mostly failed) radical inflation-fighting efforts
LONDON/NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - More governments are seeking ways to prevent surging inflation whipping up economic trouble - and even public unrest - without raising interest rates.
But as the examples below show, past attempts to rein in soaring prices without hiking borrowing costs have often ended badly.
TURKEY
Turkey has spent years slashing rates only to hike again when the lira collapses, stoking inflation.
It has dabbled with measures including FX restrictions, but this time President Tayyip Erdogan is going all-in by offering to compensate lira savers from the public purse if currency losses exceed bank account interest rates.
That could prove costly, and put at risk a main draw for foreign investors - Turkey's relatively low government debt.
""What the Turks are trying, honestly - I have never seen anything like it before,"" said AXA's chief economist Gilles Moec.
ARGENTINA
A lack of trust in economic institutions - and the peso - has plagued Argentina for decades.
Efforts by right- and left-wing governments to rein in galloping inflation have seen price freezes on many products and capital controls.
Argentines often prefer to do business in dollars but limited access to the U.S. currency has created a huge gap between official and black market exchange rates.
The central bank recently raised interest rates to 40% from 38%. But the ""real"" rate, taking inflation into account, remains deeply negative.
Goldman Sachs' Argentina economist Alberto Ramos says headline inflation has averaged 47.2% since July 2018, attesting to ""significant macro policy dysfunction and the failure of the monetary authority in securing monetary control"".
VENEZUELA
Hard-left governments have tried virtually everything over two decades, from fixing prices in 2007 to offering cut-price dollars - a policy quickly reversed due to frenzied demand.
Venezuela defaulted in 2017 and money-printing to cover the budget deficit caused hyperinflation which reached 65,000% in 2018. The IMF sees inflation at 2,000% this year.
President Nicholas Maduro eased some price controls in 2019 and lifted a ban on foreign currency transactions. Official and unofficial exchange rates were brought into line but the bolivar plunged 8,000% and Venezuela's debt-to-GDP ratio soared to 500%.
Last month Reuters reported the government was paying providers in dollars to help control inflation.
But the Inter-American Development Bank and others have warned that such 'dollarisation' leaves those unable to obtain dollars with little access to basic goods, including food.
BRAZIL
High inflation in the 1980s became hyperinflation in the 1990s, just as Brazil returned to democracy.
Under then-president Fernando Collor de Mello, prices, wages and 80% of private assets were frozen and financial transactions heavily taxed.

WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Wednesday imposed its first sanctions over North Korea's weapons programs following a series of North Korean missile launches, including two since last week.
The sanctions targeted six North Koreans, one Russian and a Russian firm Washington said were responsible for procuring goods for the programs from Russia and China.
The U.S. Treasury said the steps aimed both to prevent the advancement of North Korea's programs and to impede its attempts to proliferate weapons technologies.
The United States also proposed that five of those individuals also be blacklisted by the United Nations Security Council, which would need consensus agreement by the body's 15-member North Korea sanctions committee. read more

832,"Angry protests against feuding leaders grip Libyan cities
TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya, July 1 (Reuters) - (This July 1 story refiles to fix garbled byline)
Fury at Libya's feuding leaders boiled over on Friday as protesters stormed the parliament building in the eastern city of Tobruk and staged the biggest demonstration for years in the capital Tripoli, in the west.
The Tobruk protesters, accusing the parliament of treason and stealing public money, some eight years after its election, broke into the building and set fire to parts of it as armed forces there withdrew.
In videos posted online and confirmed by city residents, the demonstrators shouted and cheered as flames licked up the side of the building.
With political factions squabbling over control of government after failing to hold a scheduled election last year, Libya has been thrust back towards territorial division and civil war as state services gradually collapse.
Protests over chronic power cuts brought demonstrators onto the streets of several cities, braving the wrath of armed factions to voice their anger at failures that have made life intolerable during the sweltering summer months.
In Tripoli's Martyrs' Square, several hundred people gathered to shout slogans demanding electricity, criticising armed factions and politicians and demanding elections in the capital's biggest protests against the ruling elite for years.
Later on Friday, dozens of protesters stood by the government headquarters building, chanting ""we want electricity, we want electricity"".
Other protests of dozens of demonstrators also took place in each of Benghazi, al-Baydha and Misrata and some smaller towns, showing how anger at the situation extends across the frontlines of power between the country's rival forces.
""We are fed up, we are fed up! The nation wants to topple governments! We want electricity!"" shouted protesters in Tripoli, along with chants demanding elections.

WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators is discussing a scaled-back law focused on safeguarding election results and protecting election officials from harassment following Democrats' twin defeats on a voting-rights bill.
Lawmakers led by Republican Senator Susan Collins and including conservative Democrats Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, are due to meet virtually on Friday to discuss reform of the 1887 Electoral Count Act, sometimes called the ECA, which allows members of Congress to dispute presidential election results.
The ECA provided the basis for an effort by former President Donald Trump and his Republican allies to overturn the presidential election on Jan. 6, 2021, when thousands of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and interrupted the certification of election results.
Collins, who said her group includes six Democrats, told reporters that the aim is ""an election reform bill that is truly bipartisan, that would address many of the problems that arose on Jan. 6 and that would help restore confidence in our elections.""
Senator Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is separately preparing to introduce ECA reform legislation that would curb the role of Congress and place responsibility for resolving disputes and challenges with states, according to an aide.
The White House welcomed the efforts but made clear it did not regard ECA reform as a substitute for broad voting-rights legislation.
""Certainly, the president is open to engaging with, talking with, as we are, even though it's not a substitute, Republicans and others who are interested in moving forward,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters.
Lawmakers believe there is bipartisan support in Congress for such initiatives.

838,"France needs long-term spending rule to restore finances - OECD
PARIS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - France needs a multi-annual spending rule to bring its post-COVID public finances under control, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Thursday as it raised its growth forecasts.
The recovery of the euro zone's second biggest economy has surpassed most expectations this year as consumer spending bounded back following a mass vaccination campaign.
Growth is now set to reach 6.8% this year and 4.2% in 2022, the OECD said in an in-depth report on the French economy. It had previously pencilled in forecasts of 6.3% this year and 4.0% next year.
The government's support measures for the economy during the crisis left the public finances severely strained and debt at record levels, just as France plans major investments to decarbonise the economy and faces growing costs from an aging population.
With public spending already among the highest the world at nearly 60% of GDP, the OECD said France needed a multi-annual spending rule, which it said had a positive track record in curbing deficits in other high spending countries like Sweden.
It said that would force the government to rationalise spending with in-depth reviews to ensure that money is well spent, which the OECD said was not always the case given the myriad of public bodies at different levels.

It said that would force the government to rationalise spending with in-depth reviews to ensure that money is well spent, which the OECD said was not always the case given the myriad of public bodies at different levels.

April 30 (Reuters) - Brighton & Hove Albion outclassed a sluggish Wolverhampton Wanderers sideto earn a3-0 win at Molineux on Saturday and set a club record points tally in the Premier League to leave the hosts' European qualifying hopes in tatters.
A first-half penalty from Alexis Mac Allister along with goals from Leandro Trossard and Yves Bissouma after the break condemned Bruno Lage's team to their fourth league defeat in five games.
Wolves, who have now lost three matches in a row without scoring, mustered their only effort on target in the 84th minute when Willy Boly headed straight at goalkeeper Robert Sanchez after being set up by Pedro Neto.
Graham Potter's Brighton side moved up to ninth place with 44 points and reached their highest ever total in the Premier League with three games still to play. Their previous best came in the 2019-20 season when they finished with 41 points.
""It's a step in the right direction,"" Brighton defender Lewis Dunk said. ""At the start of the year we said the target was to beat last year. We have done it now. We had a rough patch but came out of the back of it.

841,"Mexican cartels swap arms for cocaine, fueling Colombia violence
BOGOTA, April 12 (Reuters) - Mexican drug cartels appear to be shipping high-powered weapons to Colombia to purchase shipments of cocaine, a trade Colombian authorities say is fueling the deadly struggle between rival traffickers for control of the nation's drug routes.
A bevy of machine guns, assault rifles and semi-automatic handguns are flowing into the South American country, a dozen Colombian law enforcement officials told Reuters.
Among the weapons popping up in traffickers' arsenals is the Belgium-made FN Five-seveN pistol, sources said. Nicknamed the ""cop killer,"" the 5.7-caliber weapon can penetrate bullet-proof vests.
Most of the 1,478 long arms confiscated from Colombian armed groups in 2020 and 2021 were foreign-made and imported clandestinely, the police say, along the same smuggling routes used to get drugs out.
Mexican drug gangs have easy access to guns purchased in the United States and long-term business relationships with Colombian armed groups, from whom they have purchased cocaine for decades, Colombian authorities said.
Now cartel emissaries are increasingly paying for shipments of cocaine with guns, authorities say, in part to avoid the need to move large quantities of cash across borders.
The potent firepower of the cartel-supplied arsenal has potential implications for Colombia's security. Heavy arms in the hands of criminals put law enforcement at risk and could further complicate the troubled implementation of a 2016 peace deal between Bogota and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels.
Last year 148 members of the armed forces and the national police were killed in Colombia, the highest figure in six years and a 57% increase from 2020, according to figures from the Ministry of Defense.
""What illegal armed groups in Colombia are doing is using the Mexicans to equal and exceed the armed forces of the state in terms of weaponry,"" an official at the police's Anti-Terrorism and Arms Tracing Information Center (CIARA) said.
""In the future, that could have serious implications, like an increase in hostilities,"" according to the official, who said armed groups may use the weapons not only against law enforcement but in battles with each other.
The agency authorized the person to speak to Reuters on the condition they not be identified.
The Colombian police say they have a permanent dialogue with their U.S. and Mexican counterparts on keeping weapons out of drug traffickers' hands.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) declined to comment, while the Mexican government did not respond to Reuters questions.
MEXICAN CONNECTION
Colombian authorities say the battle for control of their country's drug trade is waged between former FARC members who reject the peace accord; guerrillas from the still-active National Liberation Army (ELN); and members of a plethora of criminal syndicates, including the Clan del Golfo, Colombia's largest cartel.
Though FARC dissidents and the ELN espouse some of the same Marxist ideals, and they occasionally allied against the government during the height of the civil war, they now regularly fight each other and rival crime gangs to dominate lucrative drug routes, security officials said.
Law enforcement encounters with these groups are turning up powerful weapons.
In mid-December last year, Colombia's army conducted an operation against FARC dissidents in southwestern Narino province, a major coca-producing region. The military said it captured 16 people and seized a cache of weapons, including 24 U.S.-made M16 assault rifles and AR-15 semiautomatic rifles.
A similar haul was found in a different FARC dissident camp in the southern jungle province of Caqueta in 2019, according to the army: a M60 machine gun, an AR-15 rifle with an added scope for use by a sniper, and a dozen assault rifles, including M4s and M16s.
Authorities said they believe such guns are supplied by Mexico's Sinaloa, Zeta and Jalisco New Generation cartels, all of which have emissaries on Colombian soil.
Their representatives are present in 11 of Colombia's 32 provinces, according to a 2021 police intelligence report seen by Reuters.
The Sinaloa cartel, once headed by jailed kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, has the most extensive geographic reach and deepest relationships with Colombian armed groups, the report said.
Some 55 Mexicans have been accused or convicted of drug trafficking offenses in Colombia in the last three years, according to the national prisons agency.
Colombia's national police said last week they had captured Brian Donaciano Olguin, a Mexican national whom they allege served as the Sinaloa cartel's most important go-between with FARC dissidents, calling his arrest the most important yet of a cartel emissary. Reuters was unable to contact Olguin or determine if he has legal counsel.

Jan 23 (Reuters) - Francis Ngannou out-grappled Cyril Gane at UFC 270 in Anaheim, California on Saturday night to retain his UFC heavyweight crown before wrestling with questions about his future amid a feud with the promotion over his contract.
Famed for his frightening knockout power, the Cameroonian fighter changed tack to deal with the threat of his former sparring partner Gane to win a decision victory before revealing that he had torn knee ligaments in the run-up to the fight.
""If you feel like there's a chance that you can do it (fight), then you have to do it. I believe in myself, I've been through a lot of stuff in my life,"" Ngannou told a press conference.
The 35-year-old was homeless for a period after moving to France to become a boxer before coach Fernand Lopez introduced him to the MMA Factory gym in Paris, allowing him to sleep there while moulding him into one of the sport's most feared fighters.
Despite being the defending champion, Ngannou's purse for the title defence was $600,000 according to the California State Athletic Commission, a fraction of what he could earn from a boxing match with the likes of Tyson Fury.

QUITO, March 11 (Reuters) - Scientists have discovered that a type of giant tortoise present on one of Ecuador's Galapagos Islands is not from the species it was previously thought to be, Galapagos National Park said.
A study concluded that the giant tortoises living on San Cristobal island, previously identified as Chelonoidis chathamensis, correspond genetically to a different species, the park said in a statement late on Thursday.
""The scientists concluded that nearly 8,000 tortoises which exist today on San Cristobal are not Chelonoidis chathamensis but correspond to a completely new lineage that has not yet been described,"" the park said.
The discovery was made through a genetic comparison of the animals with a sample from the already described species, the statement added, in a study conducted by Newcastle University, Yale University and the Galapagos Conservancy.

INDIANAPOLIS, May 26 (Reuters) - For a long time motor racers stuck to their lanes, but increasingly drivers like Jimmie Johnson are heading in new directions in search of racing thrills.
A seven-time NASCAR Cup champion, Johnson put down a well-beaten path to the stock car series winner's circle, but on Sunday he will take on the Brickyard's notorious oval for the first time in a bid to join AJ Foyt and Mario Andretti as the only drivers to win both the Indy and Daytona 500s.
The pull of new adventures can bring purpose to accomplished drivers like the 46-year-old Johnson who is not viewing the Indy 500 as a one-off but a launch pad to a second career.
""I'm loving this experience, loving IndyCar,"" said Johnson, who qualified 12th for Sunday's 106th Indy 500. ""I would stick around as long as I could.
""I don't know what that number would be, I hope this isn't my one and only Indianapolis 500 start, I hope this isn't my one and only full-time season in the IndyCar Series either.
""I don't know what that looks like but I am going to do everything in my power to be doing this for years to come.""

853,"you have probably been catching some of the hype around the newest five-star recruits. Some of them are Chaz Guerrier, Derrick Randall, Quincy Ballard and Reid Ducharme. But who is Guerrier? Will he be able to make an impact for the Orange? Read on to learn more. Also, read up on the other Syracuse Basketball 5star recruits currently out in Baltimore.
Reid Ducharme
The 2023 class of shooting guard, Reid Ducharme, has an offer from Syracuse basketball. Ducharme has been a standout in AAU play this season, averaging nearly 16 points per game and grabbing four rebounds. He has also earned multiple offers from other schools, including Florida and Kentucky. He had a great summer, with several of them visiting him during an August Elite Camp.
Chaz Guerrier
The Syracuse basketball team is excited about the fast-rising prospect, who averaged 13.7 points per game this season while shooting 49.3 percent from the field. The 6-foot-7, 220-pound guard is a quick study, but also a team leader. In a recent workout with the Canadian men’s national team, Guerrier looked much larger than his future teammates.
Derrick Randall
Derrick Randall, a 6-foot-8, 240-pound forward, has received multiple offers from Syracuse, Louisville, and other power programs. He has played eight minutes a game last year as a sophomore for Rutgers. The 6-foot-8 forward would have two years left to play at Syracuse, but he could probably play immediately if he had an NBA contract. He is a tough defender and a good rebounder. He is visiting campus this weekend.
Quincy Ballard
The Syracuse basketball program was looking to add a veteran center to the rotation after starting Jesse Edwards last season but decided to go elsewhere. The rising third-year sophomore is transferring from Florida State, which he previously attended. The transfer from Henninger High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, went on to play at Quality Education Academy in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

859,"WASHINGTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a high-profile speech in August, outlined the arguments for why the current bout of high U.S. inflation will be ""transitory,"" and moderate on its own over time.
New data released on Friday show the jury is still out, with the personal consumption expenditures price index rising in September at a 4.4% annual rate versus 4.2% in August, continuing a run of inflation at levels not seen in 30 years.
Excluding food and energy costs, the index rose at a 3.6% annual rate in September, matching the rise in the prior three months and a sign that price increases continue even when some of the more volatile items are excluded. read more
Cornerstone Macro economist Nancy Lazar said in a webinar that she still expects Powell to be right. Consumers splurged on goods during the coronavirus pandemic. But demand for things like furniture and computers is now declining, and for many products ""we think deflation is the word"" for the coming year, with price declines for goods offsetting price increases for services and tempering inflation overall, she said.
Still, employment costs, noted by Powell as something to watch closely, rose in the third quarter at the highest rate since 2001.

The U.S. central bank meets next week to update its views about monetary policy, as officials balance their hope to support the economy with low interest rates for as long as possible against concerns inflation may be moving too fast.
Here's how the inflation story has evolved:
HIGHER PRICES AHEAD
Fed officials knew early this year that inflation would rise as the global economy rebounded from the pandemic. But where some economists felt record levels of federal spending would produce persistent price increases, most Fed officials expected a fleeting episode driven at first by simple math - the ""base effects"" of a weak economy returning to normal - along with some inevitable bumps in the reopening.
At their March 16-17 policy meeting, Fed officials marked up their inflation outlook for 2021. Powell, speaking in a news conference after the release of the policy statement and economic projections, said those ""relatively modest increases in inflation ... will turn out to be a one-time sort of bulge ... There was a time when inflation went up, it would stay up. And that time is not now.""
By September, however, inflation was running at twice the Fed's 2% target, and officials' projections moved higher.
Powell's own language shifted. ""As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could again prove to be greater and longer lasting than anticipated, posing upside risks to inflation,"" he told reporters after the end of the central bank's Sept. 21-22 policy meeting.
Some policymakers have pinpointed the end of the year as the moment when inflation needs to ease, or they'll worry they got it wrong. read more
Powell and many others still think that will happen, but on a longer timetable than first anticipated, with September data showing little evidence of the expected slowdown.
BROAD-BASED INCREASES?
""The spike in inflation is so far largely the product of a relatively narrow group of goods and services that have been directly affected by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy,"" Powell said in his August remarks.
",1538,He cited the fact that alternate inflation measures which toss out the strongest price influences remained moderate.,She cited the fact that alternate inflation measures which toss out the strongest price influences remained moderate.,He ignored the fact that alternate inflation measures which toss out the strongest price influences increased moderately.,He cited the fact that alternate inflation measures which toss out the strongest price influences increased drastically.,18.0,"WASHINGTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a high-profile speech in August, outlined the arguments for why the current bout of high U.S. inflation will be ""transitory,"" and moderate on its own over time.
New data released on Friday show the jury is still out, with the personal consumption expenditures price index rising in September at a 4.4% annual rate versus 4.2% in August, continuing a run of inflation at levels not seen in 30 years.
Excluding food and energy costs, the index rose at a 3.6% annual rate in September, matching the rise in the prior three months and a sign that price increases continue even when some of the more volatile items are excluded. read more
Cornerstone Macro economist Nancy Lazar said in a webinar that she still expects Powell to be right. Consumers splurged on goods during the coronavirus pandemic. But demand for things like furniture and computers is now declining, and for many products ""we think deflation is the word"" for the coming year, with price declines for goods offsetting price increases for services and tempering inflation overall, she said.

862,"Stronger climate action urged at COP26 to avoid 'unimaginable' health risks
- Summary
- Health risks linked to climate change are rising
- Linking work on mitigation, adaptation and health could help
- UK's NHS among health systems set to cut their own emissions
GLASGOW, Nov 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From extreme heat to worsening hunger and water shortages, accelerating climate change threatens ""unimaginable"" health consequences, scientists and health officials warned on Saturday on the sidelines of the COP26 U.N. climate talks in Glasgow.
As with the COVID-19 pandemic, ""it won't be long before the entire population of the world is affected, directly or indirectly,"" said former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, now head of UK health charity the Wellcome Trust.
But a big menu of possible changes - from making cycling and walking easier in cities to altering diets and ramping up renewable energy - could together curb warming, protect health and make life better for billions of people, experts said.
Making those shifts happen will require not just investment and efforts to make the health benefits clearer but also, crucially, bringing on board people who do not normally work on health issues.
With huge influence on air pollution and how people choose to travel, for instance, ""the minister of transport is probably more a minister of health than the minister of health"", noted Richard Smith, president of the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change.
Too often efforts to cut emissions, adapt to climate threats and deal with health problems are carried out separately, but ""we need these people to work together for integrated solutions"", said Andy Haines of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Doing so might include things like adding more trees and water-absorbing green areas in poor areas of cities, to address inequity, flooding and heat risks at once, while also boosting nature and improving mental health.
""The solutions are the same for the climate, our health and biodiversity,"" said Rayan Kassem, West Asia regional director for Youth4Nature, a green non-profit focused on climate and nature solutions.
AIR POLLUTION
Climate change is already driving diverse health threats around the world, said Haines, a professor of environmental change and public health.
For instance, the ranges of insect-carried diseases such as malaria and dengue are altering as weather patterns shift, and heat deaths are swiftly rising, with over a third of those recorded from 1990-2018 attributed to climate change, he said.
A rising toll of wildfires, floods, droughts and extreme heat is also having ""really devastating effects"" on mental health, alongside worries among many people about the future under worsening climate change, Haines said.
As permafrost melts in the fast-warming Arctic, it could even expose ""Methuselah organisms"" - long frozen and potentially deadly bacteria and viruses, he said.
""As we release these we don't know what is going to happen to human health,"" he said.
But some health risks connected to climate change are already well known.
Air pollution, much of it connected to the use of fossil fuels, kills about 7 million people a year, said Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, who heads the World Health Organization's climate and health unit.
A major step toward reducing that risk would be removing what the International Monetary Fund says are $5.9 trillion in direct and indirect subsidies to the fossil fuel industry each year, which makes polluting fuels artificially cheaper, he said.
""We need to stop spending money on the wrong things and start spending it on the right things,"" said Campbell-Lendrum, a keen cyclist who biked 1,600 km to the Glasgow summit from Geneva.
Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, whose nine-year-old daughter Ella died in London in 2013 of a severe asthma attack that coroners attributed to ""excess air pollution"", told conference participants that ""breathing clean air is a human right"".
The U.N. Human Rights Council in October passed a resolution for the first time recognising access to a healthy and sustainable environment as a universal right.
Poornima Prabhakaran, deputy director of the Centre for Environmental Health at the Public Health Foundation of India, said air pollution also had ""huge social and economic costs"" for her country, home to 15 of the world's 20 most polluted cities.
""This crisis is real,"" she said. ""We do not want a cosmetic response... We want real and tangible action.""
People already disadvantaged and least able to prepare for, respond to and recover from climate change impacts will be hurt worst, warned Susan Aitken, leader of the Glasgow City Council.
""That's as true here in a city like Glasgow as it is on a global scale,"" she said.
GREENER NHS?
As they seek ways to limit growing health threats, doctors and hospitals are also looking at ways to cut their own emissions.

863,"Biogen halves price of Alzheimer's drug to $28,200

Dec 20 (Reuters) - Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) on Monday cut the price of its Alzheimer's drug by about half to $28,200 for an average weight person after facing slower-than-expected U.S. sales on complaints from hospitals that its high cost was not worth its benefits.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug, Aduhelm, in June to treat the brain-wasting disease despite the view of its outside advisory panel that Biogen had not proven the treatment's clinical benefit.
The U.S. Medicare program, which pays for health services for people over 65 years, has scheduled a January meeting for a national policy for the drug, making reimbursement more difficult in the interim.
Biogen's $56,000 per year treatment price for an average weight person was seen as a significant cost burden on Medicare, which covers more than 60 million people.
The company said it hoped the new annual price of $28,200 will expand access to the drug among patients.
Biogen has been betting on Aduhelm, the first new treatment for the memory-robbing disease in nearly 20 years, to buffer a hit from its main revenue drivers facing rising competition.
Aduhelm brought in sales of $300,000 in the latest quarter, missing analysts' estimates.
""We are big fans of Biogen's decision to cut the price of Aduhelm, and, in our view, this makes some level of reasonable Medicare reimbursement more likely,"" Stifel analyst Paul Matteis said.
Biogen said with insurance coverage and access to diagnostics and specialized centers roughly 50,000 patients may begin treatment with Aduhelm in 2022.

RIYADH, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is the second-biggest market for luxury electric car manufacturer Lucid Group in terms of pre-orders, CEO Peter Rawlinson said on Thursday.
“It’s really my dream (to) help catalyse the genesis of an EV (electric vehicle) industry here in the kingdom,” he said at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, adding sustainable transport would benefit everyone.
Rawlinson, who did not give a figure for pre-orders, said he was heading back to California to hand car keys to the company’s first customers, and looked forward to doing the same in Saudi Arabia next year.
Lucid, aiming to rival to Tesla, has started production of its Lucid Air luxury electric sedans, equipped with a number of sensors including 14 cameras and one lidar.
Rawlinson said Lucid’s first factory, built last year in nine months, was constructed in a area that could potentially have the capacity for up to 90,000 vehicles, up from 30,000 now.
He said his dream was to bring the cost down and sell a version of the Lucid Air Pure model for $70,000, versus its first car, a $169,000 special edition of its flagship sedan.
The company says on its website it plans to deliver 520 customer-configured Lucid Air Dream Editions, followed by deliveries of Lucid Air Grand Touring versions. Touring and Pure models are expected to be delivered to customers during 2022.

- Nketiah double gives Arsenal win at Chelsea
- Everton snatch late equaliser
MANCHESTER, England, April 20 (Reuters) - Manchester City regained their one-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a 3-0 win over Brighton and Hove Albion while Arsenal upset London rivals Chelsea with a 4-2 victory at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.
Liverpool had taken over at the top of the table after their 4-0 demolition of Manchester United on Tuesday, meaning City could ill afford a slip-up at home to Graham Potter's side.
Pep Guardiola's team struggled to break down a well-organised Brighton defence in the opening 45 minutes but broke the deadlock through Algerian forward Riyad Mahrez in the 53rd minute.
Kevin De Bruyne burst forward from inside his own half, brushing off three challengers, before finding Mahrez who converted at the second attempt.
That opener settled City's nerves with the hosts scoring a second 12 minutes later as Phil Foden's effort from distance was helped past Brighton goalkeeper Robert Sanchez by a deflection.
Bernardo Silva added a late third to round off the win that moved Pep Guardiola's side onto 77 points from 32 games.
Arsenal's victory, with two goals from Eddie Nketiah was a major boost in their bid to qualify for the Champions League via a top-four finish.
The win moves the Gunners level on 57 points with fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur with both teams having played 32 matches and set to meet at Spurs on May 12..
PEGGED BACK searched for a third leveller but it was Arsenal's Bukayo Saka who rounded off the win when he converted a penalty in the 92nd minute after he was adjudged to have been fouled by Azpilicueta.
Chelsea stayed in third place on 62 points having played a game less than both Spurs and Arsenal.
At the bottom end of the table, Everton needed a stoppage-time equaliser from Richarlison to scrape a point at home to Leicester City and move four points clear of the relegation zone.
Harvey Barnes put the visitors in front in the fifth minute, poking home a pass from James Maddison from close range as Everton struggled to find their feet, and the home side did not register a shot on target in the first half.

PEGGED BACK searched for a third leveller but it was Arsenal's Bukayo Saka who rounded off the win when he converted a penalty in the 92nd minute after he was adjudged to have been fouled by Azpilicueta.
Chelsea stayed in third place on 62 points having played a game less than both Spurs and Arsenal.
At the bottom end of the table, Everton needed a stoppage-time equaliser from Richarlison to scrape a point at home to Leicester City and move four points clear of the relegation zone.
Harvey Barnes put the visitors in front in the fifth minute, poking home a pass from James Maddison from close range as Everton struggled to find their feet, and the home side did not register a shot on target in the first half.

- Summary
- Companies
- IPO expected in Q3 to raise up to $3 bln
- Listings had been planned for early Q2, sources said
- War in Ukraine creating uncertainty in equity markets
JOHANNESBURG, May 3 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola's estimated $3 billion initial public offering (IPO) for its African bottling unit will likely take place in the third quarter after market turmoil linked to the war in Ukraine upset plans to list earlier, three sources said on Tuesday.
The flotation of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) would be the biggest on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange since at least 2016 and a major boost for the flagging index.
But Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has shaken investor confidence and contributed to a plunge in volumes of IPOs in Europe, the Middle East and Africa as rising commodity prices and disrupted supply chains undermine growth and call valuations into question.
Two sources directly involved in the IPO told Reuters that Coca-Cola had aimed to list CCBA early in the second quarter, but that timetable had slipped to late in the third quarter.
""It was broadly expected to be Q2, but it was also subject to market conditions,"" said one of the sources. ""The idea is to do the IPO when there's a lot more predictability.""
The sources asked not to be named as they were not authorised to speak publicly about the IPO.
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola's largest African subsidiary CCBA announced in April last year that it would dual-list in Amsterdam and Johannesburg simultaneously within 18 months.
CCBA said it was not able to comment beyond its April 2021 announcement to target an IPO in an ""18-month period subject to market conditions"".
Coca-Cola (KO.N), which holds 66.5% stake in CCBA, did not respond to a request for comment.
A second source involved in the IPO said CCBA's European peer Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co (CCH.L) was being used as the benchmark for the African unit's valuation because of its wide exposure to developing markets.
""Coca-Cola Hellenic has seen its P/E multiples (price to earnings ratio) drop since Russia attacked Ukraine, and its share price has come down heavily,"" the source said.

872,"Explainer: Argentina's new IMF deal pushes default fears down the road
BUENOS AIRES, March 4 (Reuters) - Argentina has sealed a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $45 billion program, which will push looming debt payments down the road while tying the country to an agreed economic program.
That agreement still needs approval from Argentina's Congress and the IMF board.
WHY DID ARGENTINA NEED THIS DEAL?
Argentina, which has had 22 huge bailouts from the IMF, agreed to a record $57 billion program in 2018 under then-President Mauricio Macri. That deal failed to head off economic crisis and the country slumped into recession with high inflation.
Unable to pay back its debts, the country revamped over $100 billion in bonds with private creditors in 2020 before turning its attention to the over $40 billion outstanding with the IMF.
The country faces some $17.5 billion of payments under the 2018 agreement this year which it cannot pay.
""The agreement was necessary in order not to default with the IMF,"" said economist Roberto Geretto of Fundcorp.
WHAT'S THE NEW SCHEDULE?
Once fully approved by Congress and the IMF board, the fund is set to make disbursements of the $45 billion over a 2-1/2 year period, much of which will go towards repaying the debt from the 2018 program. Each payment will come after a review.
Those payments from the IMF would be heavily front-loaded, with over three-quarters of it to be handed out in the first six payments of a total 11 planned disbursements, according to the government's letter of intent to the lender.
Argentina will have to start making repayments from 2026, which should be completed by 2034.
""This allows extending the terms for the country to carry out reforms, normalize its situation and be able to return to the international capital markets,"" said Eugenio Marí, an economist at the Fundación Libertad y Progreso.
WHAT'S IN THE ECONOMIC PROGRAM?
The deal comes with an economic program that includes targets to hit a primary fiscal balance by 2025, rein in inflation currently running at an annual rate of over 50% and reduce central bank financing of the treasury.

877,"Indiana doctor threatened with probe over abortion on 10-year-old Ohio rape victim
REUTERS/Benoit Tessier
July 14 (Reuters) - Indiana's attorney general said on Thursday he was investigating whether the Indiana physician who performed an abortion on a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim abided by state laws requiring doctors to report the termination of a pregnancy and suspected cases of child abuse.
In a statement posted online, along with a letter addressed to Indiana's governor, state Attorney General Todd Rokita said Dr. Caitlin Bernard could face ""criminal prosecution and licensing repercussions"" if she failed to file the required reports on time.
Both Rokita and the governor, Eric Holcomb, are Republicans.
""We are investigating this situation and are waiting for the relevant documents to prove if the abortion and/or abuse were reported,"" Rokita's statement said. ""The failure to do so constitutes a crime in Indiana.""
Rokita added that he would also examine whether the doctor had violated federal patient privacy laws.
But the warning appeared to be an empty threat after the Indianapolis Star newspaper reported it had obtained documents through a public records request showing Bernard had, indeed, met the disclosure requirements in a form she filed with the Indiana Department of Health and the Indiana Department of Child Services.
The newspaper also quoted Bernard's attorney, Kathleen Delaney, as saying her client ""took every appropriate and proper action in accordance with the law and both her medical and ethical training as a physician.""
""She followed all relevant policies, procedures, and regulations in this case, just as she does every day to provide the best possible care for her patients,"" Delaney told the IndyStar in a statement.
""We are considering legal action against those who have smeared my client,"" including Rokita, the attorney general, she said.
Delaney did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for direct comment on the matter.
The Indianapolis Star broke news of the 10-year-old Ohio girl, who was raped and then traveled to Indiana to obtain an abortion because of an Ohio law banning the procedure at six weeks of pregnancy - before many women are even aware they are expecting - with no exceptions for rape or incest.
The Ohio girl was three days past Ohio's six-week limit when she left her home state to terminate her pregnancy.
The Ohio ban took effect hours after the Supreme Court's June 24 decision striking down the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that established a constitutional right to abortion to end one's pregnancy.
Abortion after six weeks remains legal in Indiana, though the Republican-controlled state legislature is expected to consider new restrictions on the procedure later this month.
Abortion rights activists, and even U.S. President Joe Biden, seized on the plight of the 10-year-old Ohio girl as a talking point to demonstrate the real-life consequences of Roe's reversal.

July 14 (Reuters) - Indiana's attorney general said on Thursday he was investigating whether the Indiana physician who performed an abortion on a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim abided by state laws requiring doctors to report the termination of a pregnancy and suspected cases of child abuse.
In a statement posted online, along with a letter addressed to Indiana's governor, state Attorney General Todd Rokita said Dr. Caitlin Bernard could face ""criminal prosecution and licensing repercussions"" if she failed to file the required reports on time.
Both Rokita and the governor, Eric Holcomb, are Republicans.
""We are investigating this situation and are waiting for the relevant documents to prove if the abortion and/or abuse were reported,"" Rokita's statement said. ""The failure to do so constitutes a crime in Indiana.""
Rokita added that he would also examine whether the doctor had violated federal patient privacy laws.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday postponed the latest Texas trial in a multi-billion dollar patent fight between Intel Corp and VLSI Technology LLC after multiple participants tested positive for COVID-19.
An attorney for Intel said U.S. District Judge Alan Albright in Austin informed the courtroom about the cases and stopped the trial over microchip technology Tuesday morning. No make-up date has yet been set, according to court staff.
An attorney for VLSI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Coronavirus case numbers have risen in many parts of the country since last month, though they are generally far below past peaks and the Austin area is not currently experiencing a major surge in cases.
A jury in Waco, Texas last March awarded VLSI nearly $2.2 billion after finding Intel infringed related patents, and Intel defeated VLSI's bid for over $3 billion more in a second trial that April.
In the third trial, which started Monday in Austin, VLSI argued that the technology used in Intel chips violates a patent related to improved data processing.

Thermo Fisher had already partnered with Moderna last year to help scale up production of its COVID vaccine, branded as Spikevax.
As a part of the 15-year expanded deal, Thermo Fisher would provide dedicated manufacturing capacity in the United States for fill/finish services as well as labeling and packaging services for Spikevax and other mRNA drugs in Moderna's pipeline.
Moderna's vaccine received full U.S. approval in January for adults and is cleared for use in more than 70 countries.
The company last week said it was developing three new vaccines based on the same messenger RNA (mRNA) technology used for its COVID-19 shot, including one for viral infection shingles. read more

894,"Exclusive: Brazil federal police warned against Bolsonaro arms agenda
G16 shooting club president Gustavo Pazzini, fires his gun during a practice session in Sao Paulo, Brazil July 28, 2022. REUTERS/Carla Carniel
Yet previously unreported documents show Brazil's federal police have long opposed the president's vision, issuing stark warnings about two Bolsonaro-backed bills to weaken gun control, including the one now awaiting a Senate vote.
In at least eight formal institutional positions, delivered to Congress from 2018 until earlier this year, Brazil's top cops said the proposals would make it harder to police the country with the world's most murders.
""We consider all these changes a setback in public gun control policy,"" the federal police wrote in December 2019 to lawmakers after the most recent measure passed the lower house.
If approved by senators, police wrote, the law would ""without doubt, result in a return to the chaotic situation in the country of excessive gun supply in circulation, including illegal ones, which could make crime rates much worse.""
Still, the federal police eventually gave qualified support - with strongly worded ""reservations"" - to the measure, which came with the president's backing.
According to a senior officer with knowledge of the documents, that conditional endorsement was a sign of Bolsonaro's influence over a force that critics allege he has staffed with allies while sidelining voices of dissent.
""There's a current, and if you don't follow the current, you're no longer part of the government,"" said the officer.
The federal police did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did Bolsonaro's office.
Thanks to Bolsonaro's policies, the number of Brazilians registering to own guns has surged sixfold since 2018 to nearly 700,000, according to the Brazilian Public Security Yearbook.
In fiery stump speeches ahead of his uphill October re-election battle, Bolsonaro has urged his followers to arm themselves or risk being ""enslaved."" Tough gun laws must be overturned, he says, as they only help criminals.
But the federal police argued in their briefings that more guns would benefit criminals.
Parts of PL 3723, the most recent bill, seemed to have been drafted ""without foreseeing the consequences of these decriminalizations for ... organized crime,"" they wrote.
The federal police's stance is striking in Brazil, where many cops are sympathetic to Bolsonaro.
Yet the congressional briefings, obtained via freedom of information request, provide rare evidence of broad antipathy toward Bolsonaro's gun agenda. Five senior officers expressed deep concerns to Reuters about Bolsonaro's gun legacy, but said internal political pressures prevented them from speaking out.
Soon after Bolsonaro took office in 2019, Eder Rosa de Magalhaes, then head of firearms control for the federal police, was pushed out of his post after refusing to sign a pro-gun briefing to Congress, according to one of the officers. Magalhaes, who now runs a regional office in central Brazil, declined to comment.
""You can't express yourself freely,"" said the source with knowledge of the briefings. ""But the federal police is very conscious that arms control has been good for Brazil - is good for Brazil.""
FIGHTING DISARMAMENT
As an obscure federal lawmaker in 2014, Bolsonaro proposed a bill giving police, spies, politicians, officials, weapons collectors, rural landowners and even journalists on the crime beat more freedom to carry arms.
Bolsonaro's bill was folded into another, PL 3722, which would have made it easier to buy, carry and collect firearms.
Police told lawmakers in 2018 there were ""several practical reasons"" not to pass the bill, which sought ""to reproduce a system that has already been recognized as ineffective.""
""There would be a clear institutional setback if this legislative proposal were approved,"" police added.
The bill has yet to pass. Faced with lingering congressional resistance, Bolsonaro has instead signed at least 41 executive orders to roll back gun regulations since 2019, according to the Sou da Paz Institute.
His most effective tactic has been to make it easier for Brazilians to register as ""hunters, marksmen or collectors,"" known as ""CACs."" Under current regulations, a marksman can immediately own up to 60 weapons, while a collector can hold an unlimited arsenal. In the first five months of 2022, an average of 1,043 Brazilians registered for CAC permits each day.
Bolsonaro, who hopes to hit 1 million CAC permits this year, says the rise in guns has helped reduce the murder rate, which has fallen steadily since before he took office, from 27 per 100,000 in 2017 to 19 last year.

897,"After recent price drops, crypto investors are questioning if Ethereum will recover from the current downturn. While this volatile asset may recover in the long run, it’s unclear how long it will take to do so.

Specifically, senior analyst Bill Noble of Token Metrics predicted that Bitcoin could drop to $20,000 by the end of the year.

The price of Ether may be building a base between $2,000 and $4,000, while some analysts believe that the cryptocurrency is in a long-term bull market. But, as the Federal Reserve steps in to curb inflation and rebalance its portfolio, ethereum’s bullishness could soon come to an end.
With high volatility, it’s hard to forecast where Ethereum will go in a few hours, let alone months. Even analysts and algorithmic forecasters had gotten it wrong in the past. Nevertheless, it’s a good idea to own a small percentage of this cryptocurrency, but don’t over-extend yourself. As long as you have a long-term strategy, Ethereum should recover from the current Crypto crash.
A key reason to stay invested in Ethereum is that it’s still one of the most innovative and stable blockchains available.

- Yuan hits 5-month peak as Biden-Xi seem friendly
- Euro struggles to rally from 16-month trough
- Bitcoin drops 5%
SYDNEY, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The yuan scaled a five-month high in Asia on Tuesday as traders welcomed dialogue between the U.S. and Chinese presidents, while the dollar held near a 16-month peak against the euro ahead of U.S. retail sales data that could influence the outlook for interest rates.
Calling U.S. President Joe Biden an ""old friend,"" his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping said their countries must increase communication and cooperation - remarks that had markets hoping cordiality could lead to a reduction in tariffs.
Support for riskier currencies ebbed as further readouts from both sides showed plenty of differences remain in ties between the world's two biggest economies, but the yuan was kept supported at 6.3728 per dollar . read more
It had climbed as far as 6.3666 per dollar.
The euro , at $1.1377, lacks major support until around $1.12 and was pounded on Monday amid concerns about COVID-19 outbreaks on the continent and insistence from Europe's central bank chief that she won't be hurried in to rate hikes.
The risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars made modest gains but retraced them as traders looked ahead to the U.S. retail sales data due at 1300 GMT. The yen steadied at 114.15 per dollar and the Aussie was last flat at $0.7344.
""U.S. retail sales today is the big watch to gauge if demand is resilient amid inflation,"" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics at Mizuho Bank in Singapore. If it is, that could mean more pressure on the Federal Reserve to hike rates sooner.
Another factor keeping moves small in the Asia session was talk that Biden might soon announce his pick for Federal Reserve chair - probably either a reappointment of Jerome Powell or a promotion for Fed Governor Lael Brainard. read more
""If Powell is chosen, we expect no impact on the dollar. But if Brainard is chosen, we expect a short term fall in U.S. interest rates and the dollar because it is widely believed a Brainard-led FOMC would be more dovish than otherwise,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Carol Kong.

The euro, at $1.1377, lacks major support until around $1.12 and was pounded on Monday amid concerns about COVID-19 outbreaks on the continent and insistence from Europe's central bank chief that she won't be hurried in to rate hikes.
The risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars made modest gains but retraced them as traders looked ahead to the U.S. retail sales data due at 1300 GMT. The yen steadied at 114.15 per dollar and the Aussie was last flat at $0.7344.
""U.S. retail sales today is the big watch to gauge if demand is resilient amid inflation,"" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics at Mizuho Bank in Singapore. If it is, that could mean more pressure on the Federal Reserve to hike rates sooner.
Another factor keeping moves small in the Asia session was talk that Biden might soon announce his pick for Federal Reserve chair - probably either a reappointment of Jerome Powell or a promotion for Fed Governor Lael Brainard. read more
""If Powell is chosen, we expect no impact on the dollar. But if Brainard is chosen, we expect a short term fall in U.S. interest rates and the dollar because it is widely believed a Brainard-led FOMC would be more dovish than otherwise,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Carol Kong.
Earlier in the Asia session, Reserve Bank of Australia head Philip Lowe again pushed back on markets pricing in RBA rate hikes as soon as 2022, but it had little immediate effect on traders who expect 100 basis points of tightening by early 2023.

902,"MOSCOW (Reuters) -Foreign investors are effectively stuck with their holdings of Russian stocks and rouble-denominated bonds after the central bank put a temporary halt on payments and major overseas’ settlement systems stopped accepting Russian assets.
Moscow is blocking foreign investors, who hold tens of billions of dollars worth of Russian stocks and bonds, from exiting after its invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of economic sanctions and a haemorrhage of assets.
The Bank of Russia said on Wednesday it had banned coupon payments for foreign investors holding rouble-denominated sovereign debt, known as OFZs, and Russian companies were also barred from paying dividends to overseas shareholders. It did not specify how long the curbs, which don’t apply to local investors, would last.
“They have no problem with paying OFZs because they can print roubles, but they seem to have decided that foreigners won’t get the money,” said Paul McNamara, investment director at asset manager GAM Investments.
“We can argue the toss about whether that is a default or not, but it doesn’t really matter because this stuff is under Russian law so they can pay them if they want to or not pay them if they can’t.”
On Wednesday, Russia’s finance ministry channelled 11.233 billion roubles ($107.5 million) from the state budget to coupon payouts on two OFZ treasury bond series. It was due to pay a 6.5% coupon the OFZs due to mature in February 2024.
The ministry did not mention whether payment was made to foreign investors, which include major asset managers such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Ashmore and Fidelity who held the February 2024 bond, according to data from the Refinitiv eMaxx database.
Its next payment on hard currency debt, coupons on two Eurobonds, is due on March 16.
“Issuers are eligible to take decisions on paying dividends and making payments on other securities,” the central bank said in a statement on Wednesday. “But actual payments ... towards foreign clients will not be made. This applies to OFZs as well.”
The National Settlement Depositary (NSD), the Russian system for overseeing the sale of securities, said it was limiting payment options on Russian securities for foreign individuals and companies, as well as a right to transfer such assets, in line with a central bank request.
The world’s biggest settlement systems, Euroclear and Clearstream, are no longer accepting Russian assets, effectively shutting off an exit route for overseas investors.
Belgium-based Euroclear said in a note on Tuesday that the NSD had blocked its accounts as a result of the central bank measures.
“To the extent legally permissible, you should wire out any remaining long balances in roubles as soon as possible,” it said.
Clearstream also informed its customers on Tuesday evening that the NSD has blocked all securities held on Clearstream Banking’s FNH Account until further notice.
Foreigners held around 3 trillion roubles ($28 billion) worth of OFZs out of a total market of 15.5 trillion roubles, according to central bank data, and nearly $20 billion, or 51%, in sovereign Eurobonds.
Foreigners held 19.7 trillion roubles in Russian shares as of July, 1, or around a third of the total market capitalisation at that time.

While the content of Bower’s book remains a complete mystery, royal expert Neil Sean thinks that the royal author could rope in Markle’s ex-husband Trevor Engleson to sound off on the Duchess of Sussex.
Speaking on his YouTube channel, Neil said: “As Tom Bower said, you know, a lot of people were willing to go on record and speak, many without being paid, we might point out as well.”
He continued: “This must be terrifying for Meghan Markle, herself because obviously, they’ve got an axe to grind, some may say, but on the other side of the coin, they definitely want to get their side of the story out.”
Neil went on to say: “But there was one person, of course, that everybody is now suspecting… What I find fascinating about this is, this particular individual would truly have a remarkable story because, after all, he would have first-hand experience of what it was like, yes what it was like, to be married the first time around to Meghan.”

908,"Indonesia calculating cost of keeping fuel prices unchanged - president
JAKARTA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Indonesia's president on Thursday said his government was calculating how much longer it can sustain a policy of keeping fuel prices unchanged, while the central bank governor hinted at keeping rates steady at an upcoming policy review.
President Joko Widodo signalled earlier this week that the government was considering raising fuel prices. He has also repeatedly said the energy subsidy budget, which has been tripled to 502 trillion rupiah ($33.84 billion) this year, is too large.
""This is such a large figure and we must know what this is for: to hold back a steep rise in inflation,"" Jokowi, as the president is popularly known, told a national coordinating meeting on inflation management.
""But can the state budget be strong enough to continue? We are calculating,"" he said.
Inflation in Southeast Asia's largest economy rose to a seven-year high of 4.94% in July, due to rising prices of food and some non-subsidised fuels.
Officials with Bank Indonesia (BI) have played down the rise in headline inflation level, saying they prefer to determine monetary policy based on the core inflation rate, which is still below 3%.
""We, for the time being, do not need to raise interest rate because of the subsidies and food management,"" BI Governor Perry Warjiyo told a news conference after the coordinating meeting, repeating that he sees ""no need to rush to raise interest rate"".
BI, one of a few Asian central banks that has not lifted rates from pandemic-era levels, is due to review its monetary policy next week.
Meanwhile, the government is confident inflation will decelerate from the July high thanks to easing prices of foodstuff like beef, chicken, sugar, shallot and chili, Jokowi's chief economic minister, Airlangga Hartarto said, predicting a range of 4% to 4.8% for 2022.

OSLO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Norway's Hammerfest LNG plant faces a further delay to restarting production after a fire in 2020, operator Equinor (EQNR.OL) said on Monday, delivering a fresh blow to hopes of securing more gas for Europe to help reduce surging prices.
The plant, operated by Equinor, is now expected to resume output on May 17, more than six weeks later than the previous goal of restarting on March 31.

UNDERWEIGHT MUTUAL FUND POSITIONING SHOULD SUPPORT STOCKS - UBS (1224 EST/1724 GMT)
With the S&P 500 (.SPX) off more than 3% to start 2022, Keith Parker, equity strategist at UBS, notes that underweight positioning should support equities, and value over growth, in the near term.
In a note on Tuesday, Parker said he sees the next equity rally, and value over growth rotation, being fueled by Q4 earnings beats as active managers raise equity exposure and growth mutual funds are overweight into reporting.
Parker said that value mutual funds are very underweight, with positioning 1.2 standard deviations below average, while on the flip side, growth mutual fund exposure jumped to 1.6 standard deviations above average thanks to about 65% of growth mutual funds underperforming their benchmarks year-to-date.
Value mutual funds continue to get better relative flows than growth, said Parker, ""add relative performance vs benchmarks should further that."" In addition, Parker said relative ETF flows favor value over growth and short interest levels for stocks in the S&P 500 growth (.IGX) are at historic lows, while value (.IVX) short interest is notably higher.
Active fund positioning is also 0.7 standard deviation below average, even with last year's rally of nearly 27% in the S&P 500, based on the firm's composite of about 900 mutual funds with about $8 trillion in assets under management and hedge fund indexes. With balanced fund exposure 1.5 standard deviations below average, macro CTA fund positioning 0.7 standard deviation below average and long/short hedge funds slightly overweight, Parker says there is ample room to support another leg up in equities.

WHO'S NEXT IN VIDEOGAME M&A? (1109 EST/1609 GMT)
Microsoft's swoop on Activision made a bang with the effects reverberating across markets and making traders speculate over who's the possible next target in the videogame M&A.
Looking at the share prices, France's Ubisoft (UBIP.PA) stands out with an 11% rally, although other studios aren't being ruled out either. Videogame makers in Europe and the U.S. all spiked on the news while Activision was up almost 30%.
""The sector may be ripe for consolidation after the Microsoft move today,"" says Jawaid Afsar, sales trader at Securequity.
""Is Ubisoft next on the list?,"" Midcap Partners says, while on a less bullish note Credit Suisse says Microsoft's (MSFT.O) bid for Activision (ATVI.O) carries a mixed reading for the French house: ""Gaming IP valuable & accelerated consolidation, BUT removes (for now) one major likely partner for UBI"".
So, trying to address the question of who's next, Neil Campling, head of TMT Research at Mirabaud, digs deeper, coming up with a longer list of potential takeover candidates from Japan to the U.S. and passing via Europe.
""A quick scan of current 'players' makes us think Electronic Arts and Frontier Developments, in particular, are high on the potential list,"" he notes.
And here are more names in the list. Bandai Namco (7832.T), Capcom (9697.T), CD Projekt (CDR.WA), Electronic Arts (EA.O), Frontier Developments (FDEV.L), Konami (9766.T), Take-Two (TTWO.O), Ubisoft (UBIP.PA).
In the snapshot you can see shares in videogame makers. Those in the red are the names in Asia, where bourses closed well before the Activision deal became news.

BANK EARNINGS PART II: INVESTORS FLEE (1050 EST/1550 GMT)
The fourth quarter earnings season was off to a rocky start with shares in some of the biggest banks falling sharply in the second day of reporting. The S&P 500 financial sector (.SPSY) is the biggest loser among the benchmark's 11 major sectors, last down 2.2%.
On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) shares are down around 8% after its profit fell nearly 13% and missed expectations as a less volatile equity market hurt trading revenue offsetting a bumper year for deals. The stock hit its lowest point since April 2021 earlier in the session and was on track for its biggest one-day percentage decline since June 2020. read more

Also in financials, brokerage Charles Schwab shares are down 5.0% after adjusted Q4 EPS was two cents shy of analyst estimates and Q4 revenue, while rising 13%, was $0.2 billion short of consensus, according to Refinitiv.
Bank of America was out with a note saying that while bank earnings have been mixed, the sector came in 5% above consensus in aggregate.
Still, the S&P 500 banks index (.SPXBK) decline of 2.4% illustrates how little this beat seems to be impressing investors especially as Treasury yields were rising on Tuesday, a move that often boosts bank stocks.

JANUARY ECONOMIC BAROMETERS SHOW OMICRON COLD FRONT MOVING IN (1046 EST/1546 GMT)
Some of the first economic data of the New Year was released on Tuesday, both of which reflect ongoing supply constraints and the resulting inflation wave, but also the first look at the extent to which the Omicron COVID variant has dragged the party down.
Factory activity in New York unexpectedly contracted this month according to the New York Federal Reserve.
Its General Business Conditions index - better knows as the Empire State
An Empire State number below zero indicates a contraction of activity from the previous month, and this month's print marks the first negative reading since June 2020, just months after mandated shutdowns to contain the pandemic sent the economy into its steepest, most abrupt recession in history.
While the employment and near-term outlook stayed in expansion territory, they lost momentum as the critical new orders component plunged to -5.0.
The one encouraging sign was a pullback in prices paid, which dropped 3.5 points to a still-elevated 76.7.
""This report has our attention, as it's the weakest major regional survey for some time,"" writes Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""But it is not definitive, and might yet prove to be more noise than signal. Our guess is that other reports will confirm that Omicron has hit activity.""
The Philly Fed report due on Thursday, which economists see accelerating, gaining 4.6 points 20, should provide a broader picture of Atlantic region manufacturing.
Meanwhile, folks in the homebuilding racket have grown less optimistic this month.

JANUARY ECONOMIC BAROMETERS SHOW OMICRON COLD FRONT MOVING IN (1046 EST/1546 GMT)
Some of the first economic data of the New Year was released on Tuesday, both of which reflect ongoing supply constraints and the resulting inflation wave, but also the first look at the extent to which the Omicron COVID variant has dragged the party down.
Factory activity in New York unexpectedly contracted this month according to the New York Federal Reserve.
Its General Business Conditions index - better knows as the Empire State
An Empire State number below zero indicates a contraction of activity from the previous month, and this month's print marks the first negative reading since June 2020, just months after mandated shutdowns to contain the pandemic sent the economy into its steepest, most abrupt recession in history.
While the employment and near-term outlook stayed in expansion territory, they lost momentum as the critical new orders component plunged to -5.0.
The one encouraging sign was a pullback in prices paid, which dropped 3.5 points to a still-elevated 76.7.
""This report has our attention, as it's the weakest major regional survey for some time,"" writes Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""But it is not definitive, and might yet prove to be more noise than signal. Our guess is that other reports will confirm that Omicron has hit activity.""
The Philly Fed report due on Thursday, which economists see accelerating, gaining 4.6 points 20, should provide a broader picture of Atlantic region manufacturing.
Meanwhile, folks in the homebuilding racket have grown less optimistic this month.

WASHINGTON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Labor on Wednesday proposed a rule aimed to override a pair of Trump-era measures that had barred retirement and pension plans from considering climate change and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors when they select investments.

928,"Ski Jumping-Slovenia win mixed team gold amid DQ chaos

- Summary
- More glory for Slovenia following women's gold and bronze
- Four-times world champions Germany disqualified after 1st round
- Norway, Austria and Japan also suffer DQs
- Shock bronze for Canada
- Chaos reigns at first Games mixed team event
ZHANGJIAKOU, China, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Slovenia won the mixed team ski jumping gold on Monday but the big talking point of the event's first appearance at the Olympics was a series of disqualifications that hit the favourites and meant world champions Germany failed to make the final.
Ursa Bogataj and Nika Kriznar, who took gold and bronze in the women's individual event, helped Slovenia to gold alongside Peter Prevc and Timi Zajc.
Taking advantage of the chaos, the Russian Olympic Committee claimed the silver medal and Canada, rank outsiders, collected bronze.
Yet the final placings seemed almost an afterthought after a night of mayhem that featured disqualifications, reinstatements and widespread fury and confusion among the sport's heavyweight nations.
Germany, who have won four successive world championships, failed to progress from the 10-team opening round after individual silver medallist Katharina Althaus was disqualified for a suit violation.
Japan, Austria and Norway - twice - also fell foul of the complex rules that link suits and skis to bodyweight in an attempt to remove any advantage that might be gained by athletes being lighter.
Officials of the impacted nations were quick to voice their frustration. ""For me it is a puppet theatre. The entire season the suits have been an issue,"" Germany's national team coach Stefan Horngacher said.
""I am unbelievably angry and I don't understand it. We had super jumps, you can only be disappointed with this.""
He said Althaus had worn the same suit as in Saturday's individual event - though if her weight has dropped since then her suit would need adjusting.
""This is a parody, but I am not laughing,"" Germany's head of Nordic events Horst Huttel said. ""It is outrageous that this happens with the four biggest ski-jump nations.""
Silje Opseth, one of the two Norwegians to suffer, said: ""I am just shocked. I do not understand anything about what happened today.""
DIFFERENT METHOD
Her team mate Anna Odine Stroem, also disqualified, said officials had used a different method to measure their suits.
""It was a bit strange and didn't conform to how it's been done in the past,"" she said. ""It is a bit the result of me being in quarantine and not eating properly the whole week.""
Japan's Sara Takanashi and Daniela Iraschko-Stolz of Austria were the others to suffer.
All five to be disqualified were female.
It was not the showcase organisers were hoping for. Although ski jumping has been part of the Olympic programme since the Games began in 1924, women joined the party only in 2014, but with only a normal hill competition while the men have normal, large and team medals to go for.
The mixed team event has been a world championship regular since 2013, with Germany winning the last four editions. They, Austria, Japan and Norway - the four teams to suffer DQs on Monday - have won all 15 available medals between them.
Slovenia did not care, however, as they continued their fabulous week, and the gold medal for Prevc completed his collection after he won individual silver and bronze in 2014.
""We tried not to think about the disqualifications but I think we still would have won so, yeah, it still feels great,"" Prevc said.
""There was a lot going on but I was just trying to just be in the zone of jumping.""
Bogataj said she was nervous after the disqualifications. ""I just tried to focus. These things happen in the sport - that's the rules.""

929,"Biden asks U.S. Supreme Court to hear 'Remain in Mexico' case
WASHINGTON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Wednesday asked the U.S. Supreme Court whether it needed to continue to implement a Trump-era policy that has forced tens of thousands of migrants to wait in Mexico for the resolution of their U.S. asylum cases.
Democratic President Joe Biden attempted to scrap his Republican predecessor's policy - often referred to as ""Remain in Mexico"" - soon after taking office in January. But after Texas and Missouri sued, a federal judge ruled it had to be reinstated and an appeals court earlier this month agreed.
Under the 2019 policy put in place by former President Donald Trump, officially called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), migrants seeking asylum must wait weeks and sometimes years in Mexico for a U.S. court date instead of being allowed to await their hearings in the United States.
Biden decried the policy on the campaign trail and immigration advocates have said migrants stuck in dangerous border cities have faced kidnappings and other dangers.
After a federal court ruled he had to reinstate MPP, the Biden administration re-issued a memo terminating it in the hopes it would overcome the legal challenges.
But the conservative-leaning 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was not convinced by the new memo, saying in its ruling on Dec. 13, that ""simply by typing out a new Word document and posting it on the internet"" was not sufficient.

U.S. charges former Taliban commander with killing U.S. troops in 2008

Oct 7 (Reuters) - A former Taliban commander already in U.S. custody has been charged with murder and terrorism-related offenses in the deaths of three U.S. troops and an Afghan interpreter and the downing of a U.S. helicopter in Afghanistan in 2008, federal prosecutors in New York said on Thursday.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan said Haji Najibullah was charged in a 13-count indictment that was unsealed in federal court. He was previously charged in the 2008 kidnapping of an American journalist and the new indictment supersedes the earlier one and includes charges related to that incident, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors said Najibullah served at the time as a Taliban commander in Afghanistan's Wardak Province bordering the capital Kabul.
He was charged in connection with an attack by Taliban fighters under his command on a U.S. military convoy with automatic weapons, rocket-propelled grenades and other explosives, prosecutors said. The attack killed U.S. Army Sergeants First Class Matthew Hilton and Joseph McKay, Sergeant Mark Palmateer and their Afghan interpreter, they said.
Najibullah also was charged in connection with an attack by fighters under his command using rocket-propelled grenades that brought down a U.S. military helicopter, prosecutors said. They said no troops died in the attack.
A statement from prosecutors said Najibullah was charged with murdering U.S. nationals, providing material support for acts of terrorism resulting in death, hostage-taking, kidnapping and other charges. The statement said the charges carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.
The indictment did not name the journalist, but a law enforcement official familiar with the matter told Reuters after the previous indictment that the case involved David Rohde, a former New York Times and Reuters correspondent who was kidnapped by the Taliban in 2008. Rohde, a Pulitzer Prize winner who is now with the New Yorker, escaped in June 2009.

943,"Trump ally Devin Nunes loses CNN defamation appeal
NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court said Devin Nunes, the former California congressman and an ally of former U.S. President Donald Trump, cannot revive his defamation lawsuit against CNN over reports he was involved in efforts to uncover damaging Ukraine-related information about Joe Biden.
In a 2-1 decision on Thursday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Nunes failed to seek a correction fast enough, or show he deserved ""special damages"" for economic loss.
Circuit Judge William Nardini said the trial judge ""did not err"" in finding that Nunes did not comply with applicable California law governing retractions, and thus his $435 million lawsuit should be dismissed with prejudice.
CNN is a unit of Warner Bros Discovery Inc .
A lawyer for Nunes did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CNN's lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Nunes sued over a Nov. 22, 2019 article that said Lev Parnas, a then-indicted associate of former Trump lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, was willing to testify before Congress that Nunes met in 2018 with a former Ukrainian prosecutor to discuss ""digging up dirt"" on Biden, a Democrat and now U.S. president.
The former Republican congressman also objected to a broadcast of CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time,"" where the reporter and host Chris Cuomo discussed his alleged role in ""looking for dirt"" on Biden and his son Hunter.
Nunes denied the accusations, said his reputation was damaged, and branded CNN ""the mother of fake news.""
Circuit Judge Steven Menashi dissented from Thursday's decision, saying the laws of New York, where the reporter and Cuomo worked, governed Nunes' claims.
Trump appointed all three judges on the appeals court panel.
Nunes has sued several news organizations in recent years. read more

945,"Japan's Q3 GDP slump seen slightly bigger than expected on soft capex - Reuters poll
TOKYO, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely contracted at a faster-than-expected pace in the July-September quarter, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, as capital spending stalled among companies hit by supply constraints.
The world's third-largest economy likely shrank an annualised 3.1% in the third quarter, the poll of 19 economists showed, a slightly bigger slump than the 3.0% contraction in the government's preliminary estimate released last month. read more
Separate data is expected to show household spending posted an annual drop for the third straight month in October, though the fall was smaller than in the previous two months, a sign that consumer sentiment had improved as COVID-19 cases remained low.
While pressures on domestic consumption are easing, next week's data suggests it may take time for Japan's economy to rebound even as policymakers have kept monetary policy loose and fiscal policy expansionary to help the pandemic recovery. read more
Economists expected the gross domestic product (GDP) revision to show capital expenditure shrank 3.9% in July-September, a slightly bigger contraction than the 3.8% drop previously forecast by the government.

Economists at SMBC Nikko Securities said Japan's economy continued to suffer a double whammy from the Delta variant and the auto industry's supply problems in the third quarter.

(Reuters) - Myra Pasek, who was the second in-house lawyer hired by Tesla Inc's Elon Musk and the first general counsel for Impossible Foods Inc, is taking on a new startup assignment, joining Silicon Valley-based robotic farming company Iron Ox Inc as general counsel.
Pasek is the first lawyer to join Iron Ox’s leadership team and will report directly to CEO Brandon Alexander, the company said Tuesday. She most recently spent three years as general counsel for Ouster Inc, which makes lidar sensors for self-driving cars and went public this year through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company.
""I've always been attracted to companies that are going to have a significant climate impact,"" Pasek said, adding that for her latest move she had explicitly sought out company like Iron Ox that could make the “biggest impact” in climate change.
Iron Ox, which says it uses robotics and artificial intelligence technology to grow greenhouse produce more sustainably, raised $50 million in a funding round led by Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures in September, bringing the company’s total funding up to $98 million.
Prior to joining Ouster, Pasek served as general counsel for meat alternative maker Impossible Foods for about a half-decade and spent another five years at Tesla, where she had also briefly led the electric car company’s European, Middle Eastern and African public relations.

- Summary
- Biden, Putin prepare for lower-level talks in January
- Putin: sanctions are a mistake our descendants would regret
- Leaders arrive at no deal to defuse tensions
WILMINGTON, Del./MOSCOW, Dec 30 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday exchanged warnings over Ukraine but conveyed some optimism that diplomatic talks in January could ease spiraling tensions.
In a 50-minute call, their second conversation this month, Biden said he needed to see Russia decrease its military build-up near Ukraine, while Putin said sanctions threatened by Washington and allies could lead to a rupture in ties. The call was requested by Putin.
""President Biden reiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation,"" said White House press secretary Jen Psaki.
Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said the call created a ""good backdrop"" for future talks.
The leaders' exchange set the stage for lower-level engagement between the countries, including a Jan. 9-10 U.S.-Russia security meeting, followed by a Russia-NATO session on Jan. 12, and a broader conference including Moscow, Washington and other European countries slated for Jan. 13.
Despite the talk of diplomacy, the tone of the call was described by officials on both sides as ""serious."" And neither country detailed significant progress towards a resolution or the outlines of any deal.
In Kyiv, leaders worry about the 60,000 to 90,000 Russian troops that have gathered to its north, east and south. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization security alliance has been making its own preparations from the west.

955,"Italy stuck in political limbo, prospect of early election grows
- Summary
- Italian president rejects Draghi's resignation offer
- Draghi expected to address parliament on Wednesday
- Government official says early elections most likely
ROME, July 15 (Reuters) - Italy might need early elections to overcome a political impasse, government officials said on Friday, after Prime Minister Mario Draghi tendered his resignation in the wake of a mutiny by a coalition partner.
President Sergio Mattarella rejected Draghi's resignation on Thursday and asked him to address parliament next week to get a clearer picture of the political situation. read more
If unity cannot return swiftly to government ranks, the only alternative would be for an election to be called in the autumn, Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said, warning that an early vote would be welcomed by Russia, but would damage Italy's economy.
""If Draghi falls, we vote,"" he told RTL radio, adding that without a fully functioning government in the coming months, Italy would risk losing billions of euros in European Union post-pandemic recovery funds and would not be able to enact measures to combat climbing energy costs.
""The Draghi government and the coalition that supported it must continue, but right now I see it as very, very difficult.""
Draghi's 18-month-old government was thrown into turmoil by the populist 5-Star Movement, which boycotted a parliamentary confidence motion on Thursday on Draghi's plans to tackle the growing cost of living, arguing they did not go far enough.
Critics say the party, which was torn apart by a schism last month, was acting merely out of self interest, anxious to raise its profile with voters following a slump in the opinion polls.
The risks of political chaos has unnerved financial markets with the premium Italy pays over German debt rising to a one-month high on Friday.
Underscoring those concerns, European Central Bank policymaker Olli Rehn said Italy could be hit particularly hard by a European energy crisis in the wake of its political crisis, saying Draghi had brought ""much-needed stability, perseverance and firmness to Italian decision-making.""
Speaking in his native Finland, Rehn said: ""It may be that we will see a very difficult period in Italy."" read more

956,"KIBALI GOLD MINE, Democratic Republic of Congo, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Canada's Barrick Gold Corp (ABX.TO) has discovered geological extensions at its Kibali gold mining joint venture in Democratic Republic of Congo that will prolong the life of the mine to 2040, Chief Executive Mark Bristow said in an interview.
The mine in the country's northeast is on track to produce gold at the top end of forecasts for the year, and geologists have found mineral reserves exceeding those depleted annually, Bristow said.
""We are starting to see geological extensions that will take us (another) 15 years, that takes us to 2040.""
A new Central Bank governor and legislature broadly supportive of President Felix Tshisekedi should aid the release of $500 million cash left over after Kibali repatriated 60% of its revenue and paid in-country expenses, he said.
Under Congo's 2018 mining code, miners must return 60% of revenue from mineral sales to the country to fund economic development.
Kibali has received special approval to pay dividends from the cash, he said, without giving details. When the money is released, it can pay further dividends and begin to pay down its debt, which is accumulating interest at 8% annually, he added.
""We've already paid some of the money out in dividends but we want a whole package.""
""We'll fix it in March legislation next year, but in the meantime we want to get it out,"" he said, without specifying which new law.

HONG KONG, Aug 12 (Reuters) - China Tourism Group Duty Free Corp (601888.SS) is aiming to raise up to $2.16 billion through a new listing in Hong Kong, according to a term sheet reviewed by Reuters, in what will be the largest share sale in the city so far this year.
Shanghai-listed China Tourism is planning to sell 102.76 million shares priced between HK$143.50 and HK$165.50 ($18.30 and $21.10) each, the term sheet said.
The offer has already been fully subscribed, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the matter with media.
China Tourism, which has built the largest duty-free retail network in China, did not respond to a request for comment on the deal's launch or subscription rate.
The launch of the deal comes as Hainan island, in China's south where China Tourism has several major shopping outlets, remains under tight restrictions due to an outbreak of COVID-19.
The price range represents a 29.3% to 38.7% discount to the stock's 201.19 yuan closing price on Thursday in Shanghai. The Shanghai shares fell 3.1% on Friday after the Hong Kong deal was launched.
Hong Kong share sales of Chinese-listed companies are typically offered at a discount to entice investors to buy the stock but the flagged discount of China Tourism is higher than normal. The rate was chosen to help ensure the stock trades positively in the secondary market, one of the sources with direct knowledge told Reuters.
China Tourism's Shanghai-listed shares have recovered most of their losses since lockdowns across Hainan began to be ordered last week. Its shares are down 11% year-to-date.
China Tourism plans to set the final price next Thursday, the term sheet said, and the Hong Kong stock will start trading Aug. 25.
Almost 40% of the stock on offer in the deal has been sold to cornerstone shareholders who will invest about $795 million, according to the term sheet.

The duty-free shop operator's deal, if executed, would surpass Tianqi Lithium's (002466.SZ) $1.71 billion deal, which opened in late June, to become the biggest share sale in Hong Kong in 2022.
Tianqi's Hong Kong shares were priced at a 50% discount to its Shenzhen stock and are trading only marginally higher since it debuted in mid-July.

HONG KONG, Aug 12 (Reuters) - China Tourism Group Duty Free Corp (601888.SS) is aiming to raise up to $2.16 billion through a new listing in Hong Kong, according to a term sheet reviewed by Reuters, in what will be the largest share sale in the city so far this year.
Shanghai-listed China Tourism is planning to sell 102.76 million shares priced between HK$143.50 and HK$165.50 ($18.30 and $21.10) each, the term sheet said.
The offer has already been fully subscribed, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the matter with media.
China Tourism, which has built the largest duty-free retail network in China, did not respond to a request for comment on the deal's launch or subscription rate.
The launch of the deal comes as Hainan island, in China's south where China Tourism has several major shopping outlets, remains under tight restrictions due to an outbreak of COVID-19.
The price range represents a 29.3% to 38.7% discount to the stock's 201.19 yuan closing price on Thursday in Shanghai. The Shanghai shares fell 3.1% on Friday after the Hong Kong deal was launched.

962,"Russia says peace in Ukraine will be on its terms, strikes multiple targets
- Summary
- Missiles, shells hit various Ukrainian regions
- Ex-Russian president says peace will be on Moscow's terms
- Says Russia will achieve all its aims
- UK says Russian offensive stuttering
KYIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A senior Russian security official said on Tuesday that peace in Ukraine when it came would be on Moscow's terms as Russian forces struck targets across the country with missiles even as their ground offensive stuttered.
More than two weeks have passed since Russia's last major territorial gain - capturing the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk - and Ukraine's General Army Staff said on Tuesday that Moscow's forces were busy shoring up their positions in recently seized territory and mounting limited but unsuccessful ground assaults, albeit in numerous different locations.
Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president who is now deputy head of its Security Council, struck a defiant tone though, signalling that Moscow was ready to do whatever it took in order to prevail.
""Russia will achieve all its goals. There will be peace - on our terms,"" Medvedev said.
He has become increasingly hawkish in his criticism of the West since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it calls a ""special military operation"" to ensure its own security.
The Kremlin has said there is no time limit to a conflict which Ukraine and the West have called an unprovoked war of aggression designed to grab territory and erase Ukrainian identity.
Britain's ministry of defence, which supports Kyiv, said on Thursday it believed Russian forces were unable to advance swiftly due to personnel shortages.
Russia is facing a resources dilemma, it said, as it must decide how much military hardware and personnel to commit to achieving its stated objective of seizing full control of Ukraine's Donetsk region and how much to deploy to southern Ukraine to contend with a Ukrainian counter-attack.
""While Russia may still make further territorial gains, their operational tempo and rate of advance is likely to be very slow without a significant operational pause for reorganisation and refit,"" the British ministry said.
In a now familiar pattern, Russian missiles on Tuesday slammed into targets across Ukraine. At least one person was killed in a missile strike on the centre of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, the regional governor said. read more
Buildings in a town in the Kharkiv region were also hit with footage showing piles of rubble being cleared by excavators.
Oleh Synegubov, governor of Kharkiv region, wrote on social media that a 75-year-old man had died due to injuries sustained as a result of shelling in the last 24 hours.
Footage in the Odesa region showed badly damaged brick-built buildings smouldering and what looked like the ruins of a long house scorched and without a roof after firefighters put out the flames.

Oleksii Matsulevych, a spokesman for the regional administration, said on Telegram that the Russian strike had injured at least four people, burned houses to the ground, and set other homes on fire.
'WE WILL NOT GIVE UP'
Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine's presidential office, wrote on Twitter that the houses had been struck by seven Russian Kalibr cruise missiles.
""A terrorist state is longing to defeat those (who are) fearless with fear,"" he wrote. ""We will neither break nor give up.""
Russia's defence ministry said its forces had destroyed ammunition depots in the area that were storing weapons supplied to Kyiv by the United States and European countries.
Reuters could not immediately verify that assertion.

Los Angeles Dodgers (+475)
The Los Angeles Dodgers are currently the heavy favorite to win the World Series and are sitting at 16-7 this season and have a major league best +57 run differential. They have been incredibly dominant at home with a 10-2 record inside of Dodger Stadium.
A huge reason for their success has been because of their pitching. They have the MLB best 2.21 team ERA as well as being one of two teams (other being the Washington Nationals) with a shutout. They have allowed 30 less hits, 13 less runs, tied for the least amount of homers, 11 less walks, 0.13 difference in WHIP, and 15 points on a batting average against them, so the pitching has been dominant.
They also have a dominating offense with guys like Mookie Betts, Trae Turner, Freddie Freeman, and Cody Bellinger all being Most Valuable Player candidates so the offense will pick up. Los Angeles should win the National League West and should dominate here so they are a worthy pick and I doubt the odds get any better than this.

966,"CD&R wins $10 bln auction for UK supermarket Morrisons
- Summary
- Companies
- CD&R wins auction with 287 pence per share bid
- Fortress loses after offering 286 pence per share
- Morrisons recommends shareholders accept CD&R's offer
- Shareholders to vote on deal on Oct. 19
LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) has won the auction for Morrisons (MRW.L) with a 7 billion pound ($9.5 (9434.T) owned Fortress Investment Group, which had made an offer worth just a penny less per share at 286 pence.
CD&R's victory marks a triumphant return to the UK grocery sector for Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Britain's biggest supermarket chain Tesco (TSCO.L), who is a senior adviser to CD&R.
Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.
If shareholders approve the offer, CD&R could complete its takeover by the end of the month, making Morrisons the second UK supermarket chain in a year to be acquired by private equity after a buyout of no. 3 player Asda, completed in February.
EGGS AND BUTTER
CD&R has committed to retaining Morrisons' headquarters in Bradford, northern England, and its existing management team, led by CEO David Potts.
It also says it will execute the supermarket chain's existing strategy, not sell its freehold store estate and maintain staff pay rates.
These commitments are not legally binding, however.
Morrisons started out as an egg and butter merchant in 1899. It listed its shares in 1967 and is Britain's fourth-largest grocer after Tesco, Sainsbury's (SBRY.L) and Asda.
The takeover battle which has been running since May is the most high-profile of a raft of bids for British companies this year, reflecting private equity's appetite for cash-generating UK assets.
CD&R's winning bid was only marginally above its 285 pence a share offer which had already been recommended in August.
The final offer represents a 61% premium on Morrisons' share price before takeover interest publicly emerged in mid-June. Some analysts have said the victor may have to sell off assets, such as factories, warehouses or stores, to make a decent return.
CD&R could combine its 918 Motor Fuel Group (MFG) fuel forecourts with the 339 owned by Morrisons, opening Morrisons convenience stores on the sites, but that could face scrutiny from the competition regulator.

969,"U.S. producer prices fall in July; weekly jobless claims climb
Aug 11 (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in July amid a drop in the cost for energy products and underlying producer inflation appears to be on a downward trend, while jobless claims rose for a second straight week in a labor market that remains tight.
The producer price index for final demand declined 0.5% last month, the first negative monthly reading since April 2020, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The PPI climbed 1.0% in June. In the 12 months through July, it increased 9.8% after advancing 11.3% in June.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would rise 0.2% in July and increase 10.4% on a year-on-year basis.
There was a drop of 1.8% in goods prices after a gain of 2.3% in June. A 16.7% fall in gasoline prices accounted for 80% of that decline. The prices of diesel fuel, liquefied petroleum gas and residential natural gas also fell sharply.
However, food prices gained 1.0% after declining 0.2% in the prior month, while the cost of services edged up 0.1% after advancing 0.3% in June.
The government on Wednesday reported consumer prices were unchanged in July, helped by a drop in gasoline prices after a surge earlier this year, but underlying price pressures nevertheless remained high. read more
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices rose 0.2% in July. The so-called core PPI increased 0.3% in June. In the 12 months through July, the core PPI advanced 5.8% after rising 6.4% in June.

971,"Traders ramp up bullish bets in U.S. oil options as prices soar
March 4 (Reuters) - Bulls have surged into the U.S. crude oil options market in recent days as futures touch highs not seen in a decade, betting that crude's rally will persist, according to analysts and exchange data.
The global oil market was already tight even before Russia invaded Ukraine last week, which has since sent benchmark Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures soaring over 15% to around 10- and 14-year highs, respectively.
The United States and allies imposed sanctions on Russia that, while not explicitly targeting Russia's daily exports of 4 million to 5 million barrels, has severely hampered its ability to sell its crude. Russia's exports account for roughly 8% of the global oil market, trailing only Saudi Arabia. read more

973,"* China to increase soybean output, focus on oilseeds
* Measures unlikely to make significant impact - analyst
* Beijing will also limit corn-based ethanol production (Adds comment from agriculture minister)
BEIJING, Feb 23 (Reuters) - China will plant soybeans on every patch of land possible this year, the agriculture minister said on Wednesday, as it seeks to reduce its dependence on huge annual imports.
The minister, Tang Renjian, announced his plan after the government outlined a raft of measures to lift soybean output, among steps to boost food security, in a major rural policy document.
“We will make great efforts ... to expand the production of soybeans and oilseeds. Each extra mu planted counts, and every jin harvested counts,” he said, using Chinese measures for land area and weight.

974,"Justin Bieber has dismissed a defamation lawsuit against two women, claiming that they were sexually assaulted by him. The women filed the suits in 2020, alleging that he was responsible for their assaults. However, the court found that the allegations were not true, and the case was dismissed with prejudice. This means that Bieber will not be allowed to file the lawsuit against the same women in the future.
The lawsuit dated back to March 2015, when Kadi Djibrine accused Justin Bieber of sexual assault in New York City. The lawyers for Justin Bieber argued that the singer never stayed at the hotel where the alleged attack took place, and that the photo evidence showed he was at an after-party when it happened. The court ruled that Kadi’s statements were false and she had no basis for pursuing a defamation suit against him.
The two women who made the accusations were both women of age. Both women claimed that they were abused by the singer at a New York City hotel in March 2015. The attorneys for Justin Bieber, who filed the defamation suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, did not give any details about the settlement. The women did not return requests for comment on the matter. While the lawsuit will continue, it will continue to be followed closely.
The two women sued Justin Bieber for defamation after publishing their allegations on the Internet. The lawsuit was initially filed in 2020 against two Twitter users for allegedly harassing the singer. While the court did not detail any settlement details, the lawsuit was deemed unfounded. The singer’s attorney has not responded to a request for comment. The suit is no longer being pursued.

Soccer Football - Premier League - Nottingham Forest v West Ham United - The City Ground, Nottingham, Britain - August 14, 2022 Nottingham Forest's Taiwo Awoniyi in action with West Ham United's Lukasz Fabianski REUTERS/Craig Brough
NOTTINGHAM, England, Aug 14 (Reuters) - A first-half goal from Taiwo Awoniyi was enough to earn Nottingham Forest a 1-0 win over West Ham United on Sunday, their first victory of the new Premier League season as the City Ground hosted top-flight soccer for the first time since 1999.
Awoniyi scored Forest's first Premier League goal in 23 years in first half stoppage time and it proved to be the difference as both teams had goals disallowed by VAR and West Ham captain Declan Rice had a second-half penalty saved.
""I'm really happy about it because it took me a long journey to get back to the Premier League and I'm very, very proud of myself,"" said Awoniyi, who was at Liverpool from 2015-21 but did not make a competitive appearance and was loaned out several times.
""It was a dream for me to score and for the team to win... I believe we will have a great season.""

NOTTINGHAM, England, Aug 14 (Reuters) - A first-half goal from Taiwo Awoniyi was enough to earn Nottingham Forest a 1-0 win over West Ham United on Sunday, their first victory of the new Premier League season as the City Ground hosted top-flight soccer for the first time since 1999.
Awoniyi scored Forest's first Premier League goal in 23 years in first half stoppage time and it proved to be the difference as both teams had goals disallowed by VAR and West Ham captain Declan Rice had a second-half penalty saved.
""I'm really happy about it because it took me a long journey to get back to the Premier League and I'm very, very proud of myself,"" said Awoniyi, who was at Liverpool from 2015-21 but did not make a competitive appearance and was loaned out several times.
""It was a dream for me to score and for the team to win... I believe we will have a great season.""

The aim is to build momentum for ICAO to set tougher climate targets when its nearly 200 member countries meet in September 2022.
The Paris Agreement does not explicitly address international aviation emissions, but commits countries to limit global temperature increases to 2C this century and aim for 1.5C.
To meet the 1.5C goal, which would avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say combined global CO2 emissions from all sectors would need to be reduced to net zero by 2050.
Montreal-based ICAO is facing pressure to toughen its climate goals. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres this month blasted the agency's plans as too weak and urged it to set ""more ambitious and credible targets"".

LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - For the Toon Army, the nickname of Newcastle United's long-suffering and fiercely loyal followers, news that the club's takeover by a Saudi Arabia-led consortium had finally been completed felt like an early Christmas present.
To be more precise, it felt like all their Christmases had arrived at once from the Middle East on a black and white sleigh loaded with the world's best footballers.

- Campus closures at Cornell, New York University and George Washington came amid finals
- Law school deans cite rising cases) - At least three law schools abruptly moved their final exams online this week after their universities announced new campus closures tied to COVID-19.
Cornell University on Tuesday shut down its Ithaca campus after reporting nearly 500 COVID-19 cases last week, halfway through the law school’s nine-day finals period. New York University and George Washington University each followed suit Wednesday, citing the fast spread of COVID-19.
All three universities require students to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to be on campus, but each has reported a rise in the Omicron variant among their recorded cases. Preliminary data suggests Omicron may be particularly contagious while less likely to cause severe illness, though much remains unknown as the variant continues its spread.
George Washington’s law school was already grappling with what it said was a cyberattack on Dec. 10 that disabled the online platform housing class materials such as notes and previous exams. The school opted to move ahead with in-person exams this week, only to reverse course Wednesday at the direction of university leaders.
Under the university’s earlier policy, George Washington law students had the option to take Thursday’s finals either on campus or remotely. But all five of the exams scheduled for Friday will be remote, according to a law school spokeswoman. Friday is the last day of the school’s final exam period.
New York University School of Law canceled all in-person finals as of Wednesday morning and informed students that remaining exams would be administered remotely.

NEW YORK/SYDNEY, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Bitcoin and ether hit record peaks on Tuesday, with enthusiasm for cryptocurrency adoption and worry about inflation driving momentum and flows into the asset class.
Though both virtual currencies pulled back from their highs in the U.S. session, their trajectory was clearly headed higher.

1001,"Analysis: Free-falling lira puts Turkey in balance of payments danger
Turkish lira banknotes are seen in this illustration taken in Istanbul, Turkey November 23, 2021. REUTERS/Murad Sezer/Illustration
- Summary
- Lira has fallen 23% this month, over 40% this year
- Cost of refinancing nearly $170 of dollar debt in 2022 is rising
- Low debt-to-GDP gives Turkey some breathing space
- Currency reserves are depleted but low debt a relief
LONDON, Nov 24 (Reuters) - A big fall in Turkey's lira is hardly rare these days, but the currency's precipitous 20% plunge over the last week is ramping up risks of a balance of payments crisis unless authorities can somehow pull the brake.
The lira fell 15% at one point on Tuesday alone, ending the day with its largest daily drop since its tumultuous 2018 crisis, and analysts are worried the declines could rumble on.
The crux is that the country's central bank is bowing to political pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan to deliver interest rate cuts despite 20% inflation that could reach 30% or even 50%, economists say, if the lira can't recover.
Register now for FREE unlimited access to reuters.com
Years of failed FX interventions mean currency reserves are now around $30 billion in deficit once central bank FX swap deals are accounted for, compared to positive $30 billion in 2018. Things could worsen if Turks themselves start pulling money out again.
""The options on the table are limited,"" Societe Generale's Phoenix Kalen said on how the current lira rout could be stopped. ""In light of depleted FX reserves: capital controls or a series of emergency rate hikes.""
Erdogan has doubled down on his opposition to high interest rates saying he rejects policies that would ""condemn our people to unemployment, hunger and poverty"", but most veteran Turkey watchers think rate hikes will have to come. read more
Goldman Sachs expects the current 15% rates will go back up to 20% before mid next year, pointing out that traditional economic models and rules show 26% rates are needed to bring inflation back to the central bank's 5% target.
""Considering that elections are only 18 months away, we think that such an option is unlikely,"" Goldman's analysts acknowledged.
Some though, including Ahmet Davutoglu, a former prime minister who served alongside Erdogan, warn the lira slump risks a balance of payments crisis - when a country no longer has the money or the ability to borrow it to pay for essentials.
Credit rating agency S&P Global last month estimated that over the next 12 months close to $170 billion of mainly dollar-denominated foreign currency debt needs to be refinanced - the equivalent to 23% of GDP and far more than reserves could cover.
If the lira slump makes that task difficult or in some cases impossible, woes could quickly spiral.
Turkey has hit such difficulties in the past -- it needed an IMF rescue in 1999 -- and Davutoglu says because so much of Turkey's debt is in dollars, 3 trillion lira ($236 billion) has been added to the country's debt by this crisis.
""The picture we face now will bring with it a balance of payments crisis similar to that of the 1970s,"" he said on Tuesday.
Erdogan said this week that Turkey's banking sector and budget are strong, adding the government does not have immediate financing needs for investments.
""We know very well what we are doing with this policy, why we are doing it, which risks we face and what we will obtain at the end,"" Erdogan said.
RISING COSTS
Others also think a BoP crisis isn't on the cards just yet.
The Institute of International Finance estimates this year's current account deficit stands at $15 billion, or 2.1% of GDP, compared to $22 billion, or 2.8%, back in 2018.
UBS' head of EM Strategy Manik Narain thinks the main reason is because with a debt ratio of less than 40% of its annual GDP, Turkey can still afford bail-outs of banks and big firms if need be.

""The options on the table are limited,"" Societe Generale's Phoenix Kalen said on how the current lira rout could be stopped. ""In light of depleted FX reserves: capital controls or a series of emergency rate hikes.""
Erdogan has doubled down on his opposition to high interest rates saying he rejects policies that would ""condemn our people to unemployment, hunger and poverty"", but most veteran Turkey watchers think rate hikes will have to come. read more
Goldman Sachs expects the current 15% rates will go back up to 20% before mid next year, pointing out that traditional economic models and rules show 26% rates are needed to bring inflation back to the central bank's 5% target.
""Considering that elections are only 18 months away, we think that such an option is unlikely,"" Goldman's analysts acknowledged.
Some though, including Ahmet Davutoglu, a former prime minister who served alongside Erdogan, warn the lira slump risks a balance of payments crisis - when a country no longer has the money or the ability to borrow it to pay for essentials.
Credit rating agency S&P Global last month estimated that over the next 12 months close to $170 billion of mainly dollar-denominated foreign currency debt needs to be refinanced - the equivalent to 23% of GDP and far more than reserves could cover.
If the lira slump makes that task difficult or in some cases impossible, woes could quickly spiral.
Turkey has hit such difficulties in the past -- it needed an IMF rescue in 1999 -- and Davutoglu says because so much of Turkey's debt is in dollars, 3 trillion lira ($236 billion) has been added to the country's debt by this crisis.
""The picture we face now will bring with it a balance of payments crisis similar to that of the 1970s,"" he said on Tuesday.
Erdogan said this week that Turkey's banking sector and budget are strong, adding the government does not have immediate financing needs for investments.
""We know very well what we are doing with this policy, why we are doing it, which risks we face and what we will obtain at the end,"" Erdogan said.
RISING COSTS
Others also think a BoP crisis isn't on the cards just yet.
The Institute of International Finance estimates this year's current account deficit stands at $15 billion, or 2.1% of GDP, compared to $22 billion, or 2.8%, back in 2018.
UBS' head of EM Strategy Manik Narain thinks the main reason is because with a debt ratio of less than 40% of its annual GDP, Turkey can still afford bail-outs of banks and big firms if need be.

HAVANA, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Cuban authorities said on Wednesday that neighboring countries had deported more than 1,200 migrants thus far in 2021, returning them to Havana in bilateral operations coordinated with the United States, Mexico, the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas.

1004,"White House kicks off push to train more broadband, construction and EV workers
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Reuters) - The White House will launch a summer-long initiative on Friday to encourage labor unions and industry to work together to train more workers for good jobs in the electric vehicle, broadband and construction sectors, senior administration officials said.
The ""Talent Pipeline Challenge"" will encourage employers and state and local governments to use $800 million in job training funds from the $1 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, they said. Billions more will come from the American Rescue Program rescue package to boost the supply of workers for high-quality jobs.
U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, National Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice and other top officials will meet at the White House with executives from telecoms giant AT&T (T.N); Bechtel, the largest U.S. construction firm; Germany's Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), union leaders and workforce experts to share ideas on how to train more workers for well-paying jobs in those sectors.

MELBOURNE, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Distraught and in tears, Tim Paine stepped down as captain of Australia's test cricket team on Friday after revelations he had been investigated and cleared over sexually explicit text messages sent to a female colleague four years ago.
The scandal plunged Australia's Ashes preparations into disarray three weeks before the first test begins in Brisbane and placed the 36-year-old wicketkeeper's international career in jeopardy.
Breaking down while reading from a statement, Paine admitted he had been investigated by the sport's national integrity unit over messages he sent to a former Cricket Tasmania staffer in 2017, a few months before he took over the captaincy.
Though cleared of wrongdoing, the husband and father-of-three said, on reflection, his actions had not met the standards of an Australian cricket captain or the wider community.
""I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and pain that I have caused to my wife, my family, and to the other party,"" Paine told reporters in Hobart.
""I'm sorry for any damage that this does to the reputation of our sport and I believe that it is the right decision for me to stand down as captain, effective immediately.""
The tenures of Australia's last two captains have now been book-ended by scandal, with Paine replacing Steve Smith in the wake of the Newlands ball-tampering affair in 2018.
'APPALLING' BEHAVIOUR
Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper published alleged text message exchanges between Paine and the woman, and said she had complained that he had sent an unsolicited picture of his genitals.
""Will you want to taste my .... ?? Fuck me, I’m seriously hard,"" the paper quoted Paine as saying in a text.
Cricket authorities.
However, his exoneration in the earlier probe, and Cricket Tasmania's characterisation of the matter as ""between mature adults"", may not be enough to save him.
The investigation lay buried for nearly four years and may have stayed that way indefinitely, had the Herald Sun not reported the sordid details immediately before his mea culpa.
""We thought this incident was behind us and that I could focus entirely on the team, as I have done for the last three or four years,"" said Paine, who was married to wife Bonnie in 2016.
""However, I recently became aware that this private text exchange was going to become public.""
Paine said he was still available for selection but cricket pundits could not see how he could remain in the team, with his presence likely to be a huge distraction before and during the Ashes.
Local cricket fans spoke of the traditional adage, that the captaincy of the test team is the country's ""second highest office"" after the Prime Minister.
""The man's in a marriage with children, he's the captain of the Australian cricket team,"" Sydney resident Craig Jarman told Reuters.
""I mean it's just appalling, appalling what he's been doing and what's been happening.""

1017,"Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gilbertt’s Scream added an exciting new chapter to the popular series of slashers, but the movie’s conclusion was filled with gore-filled twists. It was nearly 25 years since Wes Craven launched the first Scream film in the year 2022, the town of Woodsboro was the scene of another murder, bringing the three main characters Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), Dewey Riley (David Arquette) as well as Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox). But at the heart in 2022’s Scream was a newcomer Sam Carpenter (Melissa Barrera).
In a scene paying tribute in a nod to the Casey Becker’s (Drew Barrymore) death scene in 1996’s Scream the sister of Sam, Tara (Jenna Ortega) is attacked by Ghostface when she is home on her own. The result is Sam as well as Sam’s boyfriend Richie (Jack Quaid) as well as Tara’s circle of friends becoming the new Woodsboro victims. Sidney, Dewey, and Gale are also added to the fray when it becomes clear that the latest Ghostface killings are tied to the first massacre by Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) and Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard) more than two decades ago.
Scream‘s old characters were moving on from Scream4 believed that they had won However they knew that there was a bigger threat. The duo of Bettinelli-Olpin as well as Gillett were charged with taking over a popular series that had a massive fan following. They not only made sure to increase the gore using a fun lens, but they employed the concept of fandom to create an entirely new spin on the series, notably the character of The Scream‘s Ghostface character and the ending.

After Sidney bravely confronted horror once more, Richie revealed himself as the second Ghostface killer. Amber as well as Richie had created an elaborate “third act” as a method of putting the latest Woodsboro murders on Sam as they claimed that the previous characters, particularly Sidney required to be killed. Tara was able to stop them for a short time which forced the killers to separate with Amber working with Sidney along with Gale while Richie determined to target Sam. After a fight within the kitchen Sidney as well as Gale bested Amber and shot her while she erupted into flames in the oven after being bathed in alcohol. In the meantime, Sam, who suffered an injury similar to Sidney and Gale, fought Richie. After imagining her father’s face, Sam got hold of an uncontrollably sharp knife and struck Richie into death. In another reference to the initial screaming, Amber jumped back to life, causing Sam to insert some more bullets into her.

The group also took advantage of weaknesses in Microsoft's (MSFT.O) methods for identifying users in Office 365, breaching some targets that used Microsoft software but not SolarWinds.

1019,"Foreigners banned from selling Russian stocks as market set for limited reopening

March 23 (Reuters) - Russia plans to resume some stock trading on Thursday after a near month-long hiatus, with 33 rouble securities to be traded on the Moscow Exchange. Non-residents will have to wait, though - they will be barred from selling stocks and OFZ rouble bonds until April 1.
Trading in blue chips, including state lenders Sberbank (SBER.MM) and VTB (VTBR.MM), energy majors Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and Gazprom (GAZP.MM), will take place between 0650 and 1100 GMT, with short-selling banned, the central bank said on Wednesday.
Russian stocks last traded on the Moscow Exchange on Feb. 25. The central bank then curbed trading as Western sanctions over events in Ukraine threw markets into turmoil.
Until April 1, foreign investors are allowed to conduct operations to lower their obligations including repo deals and deals with derivative instruments, but not to sell shares or OFZ rouble treasury bonds, the Moscow Exchange said.
The central bank started to buy OFZ rouble treasury bonds to support the domestic debt market when it reopened on Monday, and the finance ministry said it plans to spend 1 trillion roubles to buy Russian companies' shares.
The limited re-opening by MOEX comes after the SPB Exchange (SPBE.MM), , Russia's second-largest bourse, partially restarted trade in foreign shares on Monday, allowing trading of the 15 most liquid stocks including Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Boeing (BA.N) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O).
From midday on Wednesday, SPB Exchange allowed securities of another 1,639 foreign companies to be bought and sold by domestic market players, most of whom are Russian residents who use the platform to trade foreign stocks.
Trading and settlement is conducted in U.S. dollars but the funds will remain on the brokerage accounts and cannot be cashed out amid Western sanctions on Russia and capital controls that Moscow has introduced in retaliation, the exchange said.

1022,"Ghana blast leaves survivors with cuts and questions
APIATE, Ghana, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Nancy Nyarko was preparing porridge at her roadside stall near the edge of the village of Apiate in Ghana's western mining region when she heard a loud noise close by.
Looking up, she saw a motorbike had collided with a large truck and caught fire, Nyarko said, her right hand and left leg wrapped in bandages.
The crash happened at 13:25 on Jan 20. In less than an hour Apiate was reduced to a wasteland of rubble, timber and twisted metal, a 20m (65 ft) crater yawning at its core from an explosion. At least 13 people were dead and nearly 200 injured.
What residents didn't know was that the truck, owned by the Spanish company Maxam, contained 10 tons of explosives meant to blast rock in the Chirano gold mine, run by Toronto-based Kinross Gold Corporation (K.TO), around 140 km (87 miles) further north. read more
The explosion exposed the risk of transporting mining goods in poor areas with limited emergency response.
The truck was on fire for 45 minutes before the blast, in which time residents were allowed to walk to the scene to take photos and video without police or firemen holding them back, eight eye witnesses said.
Survivors were left with cuts and lingering questions about extent of safety precautions and the speed and effectiveness of the authorities' response.
""The truck stopped and the driver got out and started waving,"" Nyarko said.
""He ran into a shop and told the people to get out. I couldn't hear him from where I was but I could see him gesturing for people to get away, so I also decided to leave,"" Nyarko said.
Ghana Police spokesman Kwesi Ofori told Reuters the truck had been escorted by a Maxam car with a flashing security light in front, and a police car behind.
A police document, shared by Ofori, showed the escort was carrying 10 tons of explosive and signed off by the regional command in Tarkwa on Jan. 19. The truck driver and policeman told a nearby school to evacuate its pupils and a fuel station to shut down, Ofori said.
""When he saw what happened, the policeman quickly reversed far away and started alerting people to be careful about what was happening,"" Ofori said.
""The escort police also alerted the fuel station and they shut. That also could have been a major disaster,"" Ofori said.
Nancy and seven other witnesses of the accident said they did not recall seeing a police escort and a Maxam car with a flashing light, or that a policeman helped warn the villagers.
The manager of the GOIL fuel station, Fred Antwi, said he did not speak to any police officers, and police from the station in Bogosoro, around a mile away, didn't arrive until after the blast.

LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - Forecasts that British temperatures could hit a record high this week forced train operators to cancel or slow services on Monday, reawakening an age-old debate about why the British rail network struggles in the heat.
As the mercury soared, Britain's rail companies imposed speed restrictions on the network due to the risk that extreme temperatures could force the metal rails to buckle and overhead power lines to sag, meaning journeys would take longer than normal. read more

1025,"High rates of methane spewing from U.S. Permian oilfield operations - report
WASHINGTON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Methane continues to escape at a high rate from oil and gas operations in the Permian Basin, according to an aerial survey released Tuesday that detected major methane plumes from 40% of 900 sites that were measured.
The latest research conducted by the Environmental Defense Fund via helicopter during the first two weeks of November found that 14% of those plumes were the result of malfunctioning flares.
Researchers also found that at one-third of smaller wells significant emissions persisted for days. The aerial survey of the largest U.S. oilfield showed that leaks arose from different pieces of equipment at different times.
This was the eighth aerial survey conducted by EDF's PermianMAP initiative, which monitors methane from the upstream, downstream and midstream operations in the oilfield. The survey comes weeks after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed the first regulations targeting methane from the country's existing oil and gas facilities.
The Biden administration also set a goal to reduce 30% of all methane emissions by 2030 as part of its participation in the Global Methane Pledge, which was formally launched at the U.N. Climate summit in Glasgow.
“This research makes clear that the agency (EPA) must tackle frequent, large emissions from smaller wells if we’re going to have a shot at achieving our climate goals and protecting communities from air pollution,” said Jon Goldstein, senior director of regulatory and legislative affairs at the EDF.
Oil and gas companies that operate in the Permian have tried to show they intend to address the high rate of methane emissions from the basin ahead of the forthcoming EPA rules.

NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - A rate hike cycle that started last year and low valuations had already made Latin America a darling destination for investors in 2022, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine is likely to keep cash flowing to the commodity-exposed region.
The risks are country-specific, and mostly coming from electoral exposure or a further spike in inflation, analysts said.
Latin American stock markets measured in dollars are outperforming larger economies by close to 25 percentage points this year, with MSCI's Latam index (.MILA00000PUS) up 11% YTD while the developed world index (.MIWD00000PUS) is down close to 13%.
So far this year, foreign flows to Latam stock and bond portfolios totaled about $18 billion through February, while the rest of EM pulled in a net $7.5 billion.
The Ukrainian invasion, dubbed a ""special operation"" by Moscow, has heightened risk aversion across emerging Europe but could add to the ongoing outperformance from Latin America.
""Amid all the current volatility, Latin America may have some opportunities. Some markets may be positively impacted by higher commodity prices, and also by a higher volume of investment flows by Emerging Market portfolio managers,"" said Alfonso Eyzaguirre, CEO of JPMorgan Chase Latin America and Canada.
He added that investment restrictions in Russia, Ukraine and neighboring countries can increase Latin America's weight in emerging market portfolios.

Regional currencies have also performed better this year. The four best-performing across emerging markets against the dollar are from Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Chile. Alongside spikes in the price of oil and food, the currency moves have added to the regional tailwind.
""The main impact on Latin America is coming via commodity price moves – this seems to have supported currencies like the Brazilian real and Colombian peso. Insofar as there are clearer beneficiaries from these commodity price moves, it’s the oil exporters like Colombia."" said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
""But there will be a cost across the region from higher commodity prices – it’s likely to lift inflation, and central banks are likely to hike interest rates more aggressively.""

People walk past the Central Business District (CBD) in Beijing, China January 16, 2022. Picture taken January 16, 2022. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang
HONG KONG, May 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s ailing property sector is proving to be a tough repair job. The sluggish economy and pandemic-related lockdowns have only increased the degree of difficulty. Policymakers are digging deeper into the toolbox, but a lack of faith in the industry’s foundations make it harder to rebuild.
The People’s Bank of China recently joined wider efforts to help, by lowering the benchmark five-year loan rate by 15 basis points to 4.45%. Local governments also have dropped restrictions, such as Harbin’s ban on homeowners from selling within three years of purchase, per credit analyst CreditSights. Other regions reduced down-payment rates while banks in some big cities have quickened mortgage approval times.
These moves are having only a limited effect, however, as prospective homebuyers worry their builder might collapse. New home sales fell 32% in the first four months of the year, after having risen 5% in 2021. At least 18 developers, including Guangzhou R&F Properties (2777.HK) and Redco Properties (1622.HK), have this year swapped offshore debt coming due for new notes, according to Goldman Sachs research. Most of those bonds still trade at or below 30% of face value, implying that investors aren’t convinced the extensions improve their chances of being paid back. Small wonder: four of them have defaulted since exchanging.
Without stabilising the developers, it’s hard to see how boosting demand will make much difference. Chinese authorities have encouraged stronger companies to take over weaker rivals, but it’s a hard sell with banks in retreat. Domestic loans to developers slumped 24% in the four months to April 30 compared to the same span a year earlier. Opaque bankruptcy and workout processes aren’t helping either. Two smaller operators that collapsed a couple of years ago owing $1.5 billion in offshore debt between them have yet to make material progress resolving their affairs. That’s hardly encouraging for any bargain hunters.
Chiseling away at the effects of a runaway housing market cries out for stiffer resolve. Beijing is capable, evidenced by the strict leverage curbs it imposed on developers in the first place. Circumstances have changed, though, and cheaper mortgages will achieve only so much. If China is serious about wanting to buttress property developers, it’ll take a bolder economic blueprint.

1033,"WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats are urging the Biden administration to allow at least 2 million immigrants in the country illegally to prolong their stay and to prevent deportation to home countries where natural disasters and crises prevent their safe return.
They want President Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat, to take executive action to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Central American immigrants from Guatemala and expand eligibility for those from El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.
Senator Robert Menendez and more than 30 fellow Democrats wrote to top administration officials calling on them to act after a failed push last year to pass immigration reform during Biden's first year in office.
Arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border reached record highs last year, fueled by new arrivals from Central America.
TPS allows people already in the United States at the time of the designation to stay and work legally if their home countries have been affected by natural disasters, armed conflicts or other events that prevent their safe return.
The designations, which are issued by the secretary of homeland security, last six to 18 months and can be renewed indefinitely.

BEIRUT, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions on two top Lebanese contractors and a lawmaker close to the Hezbollah movement over alleged large-scale corruption that undermined the rule of law in Lebanon.
